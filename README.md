# Main Project Goal

The primary objectives of this project can be summarized as follows:

### Knowledge Retrieval

Develop a system capable of extracting relevant knowledge, concepts, instances, and relationships from two key sources:

- **Project Management Institute's (PMI) Corpus**: Specifically, the PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge) 6th edition.
- **PMI's Standard for Project Risk Management (PRM)**: Extracting knowledge from PMI's standard for PRM.

This step involves the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using transformer models.

### Conceptual Graph Building

Automatically structure and represent the acquired project management knowledge into machine-readable formats, including:

- **OWL (Web Ontology Language)**
- **RDFS (Resource Description Framework Schema)**
- **RDF (Resource Description Framework)**

This step involves machine learning and deep learning techniques to create ontological elements.

### Recommendation Engine

Develop a recommendation system based on the constructed conceptual graph. This system will encapsulate the interdependencies between project management concepts and provide:

- Personalized recommendations
- Advice to project stakeholders based on their queries and profiles

### Web Application

Implement a web-based system to support project practitioners, including:

- Project Managers
- Risk Owners
- Risk Action Owners

This system will facilitate their decision-making processes by providing:

- Real-time personalized recommendations
- Relevant project-related information
