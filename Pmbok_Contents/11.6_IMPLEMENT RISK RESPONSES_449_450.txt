11.6 IMPLEMENT RISK RESPONSESImplement Risk Responses is the process of implementing agreed-upon risk response plans. The key benefit of this process is that it ensures that agreed-upon risk responses are executed as planned in order to address overall project risk exposure, minimize individual project threats, and maximize individual project opportunities. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 11-18. Figure 11-19 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.Figure 11-18. Implement Risk Responses: Inputs, Tools & Techniques, and Outputs Figure 11-19.
