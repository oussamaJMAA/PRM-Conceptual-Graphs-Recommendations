11.2 IDENTIFY RISKSIdentify Risks is the process of identifying individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk, and documenting their characteristics. The key benefit of this process is the documentation of existing individual project risks and the sources of overall project risk. It also brings together information so the project team can respond appropriately to identified risks. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 11-6. Figure 11-7 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process. Figure 11-6.
