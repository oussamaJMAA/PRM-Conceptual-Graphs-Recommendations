11.5 PLAN RISK RESPONSESPlan Risk Responses is the process of developing options, selecting strategies, and agreeing on actions to address overall project risk exposure, as well as to treat individual project risks. The key benefit of this process is that it identifies appropriate ways to address overall project risk and individual project risks. This process also allocates resources and inserts activities into project documents and the project management plan as needed. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 11-16.  Figure 11-17 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.Figure 11-16.
