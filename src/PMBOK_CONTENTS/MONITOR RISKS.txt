11.7 MONITOR RISKSMonitor Risks is the process of monitoring the implementation of agreed-upon risk response plans tracking identified risks identifying and analyzing new risks and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project. The key benefit of this process is that it enables project decisions to be based on current information about overall project risk exposure and individual project risks. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs tools and techniques and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 11-20. In order to ensure that the project team and key stakeholders are aware of the current level of risk exposure project work should be continuously monitored for new changing and outdated individual project risks and for changes in the level of overall project risk by applying the Monitor Risks process. The Monitor Risks process uses performance information generated during project execution to determine if:Implemented risk responses are effectiveLevel of overall project risk has changedStatus of identified individual project risks has changedNew individual project risks have arisenRisk management approach is still appropriateProject assumptions are still validRisk management policies and procedures are being followedContingency reserves for cost or schedule require modification andProject strategy is still valid.
