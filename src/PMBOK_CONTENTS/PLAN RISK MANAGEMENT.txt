Plan Risk Management is the process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project. The key benefit of this process is that it ensures that the degree type and visibility of risk management are proportionate to both risks and the importance of the project to the organization and other stakeholders. This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs tools and techniques and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 11-2. The Plan Risk Management process should begin when a project is conceived and should be completed early in the
project. It may be necessary to revisit this process later in the project life cycle, for example at a major phase change, or
if the project scope changes significantly, or if a subsequent review of risk management effectiveness determines that
the Project Risk Management process requires modification.
