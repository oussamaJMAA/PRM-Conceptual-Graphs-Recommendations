11.6 IMPLEMENT RISK RESPONSESImplement Risk Responses is the process of implementing agreed-upon risk response plans. The key benefit of this process is that it ensures that agreed-upon risk responses are executed as planned in order to address overall project risk exposure minimize individual project threats and maximize individual project opportunities. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs tools and techniques and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 11-18. Figure 11-19 depicts the data ï¬‚ow diagram for the process.Proper attention to the Implement Risk Responses process will ensure that agreed-upon risk responses are actually
executed. A common problem with Project Risk Management is that project teams spend effort in identifying and
analyzing risks and developing risk responses, then risk responses are agreed upon and documented in the risk register
and risk report, but no action is taken to manage the risk.
Only if risk owners give the required level of effort to implementing the agreed-upon responses will the overall risk
exposure of the project and individual threats and opportunities be managed proactively.
