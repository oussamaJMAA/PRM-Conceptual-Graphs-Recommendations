PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT,11PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENTProject Risk Management includes the processes of conducting risk management planning identification analysis response planning response implementation and monitoring risk on a project. The objectives of project risk management are to increase the probability and/or impact of positive risks and to decrease the probability and/or impact of negative risks in order to optimize the chances of project success.The Project Risk Management processes are:11.1 Plan Risk Management—The process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project.11.2 Identify Risks—The process of identifying individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk and documenting their characteristics.11.3 Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis—The process of prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis or action by assessing their probability of occurrence and impact as well as other characteristics.11.4 Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis—The process of numerically analyzing the combined effect of identified individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty on overall project objectives.11.5 Plan Risk Responses—The process of developing options selecting strategies and agreeing on actions to address overall project risk exposure as well as to treat individual project risks.11.6 Implement Risk Responses—The process of implementing agreed-upon risk response plans.11.7 Monitor Risks—The process of monitoring the implementation of agreed-upon risk response plans tracking identified risks identifying and analyzing new risks and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project.Figure 11-1 provides an overview of the Project Risk Management processes. The Project Management Risk processes are presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces while in practice they overlap and interact in ways that cannot be completely detailed in this PMBOK® Guide.

They do this in a context of constraints and assumptions while responding to stakeholder expectations that may be conﬂicting and changing. Organizations should choose to take project risk in a controlled and intentional manner in order to create value while balancing risk and reward.Project Risk Management aims to identify and manage risks that are not addressed by the other project management processes. When unmanaged these risks have the potential to cause the project to deviate from the plan and fail to achieve the defined project objectives. Consequently the effectiveness of Project Risk Management is directly related to project success.Risk exists at two levels within every project. Each project contains individual risks that can affect the achievement of project objectives. It is also important to consider the riskiness of the overall project which arises from the combination of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty. Project Risk Management processes address both levels of risk in projects and these are defined as follows:Individual project risk is an uncertain event or condition that if it occurs has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives.Overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole arising from all sources of uncertainty including individual risks representing the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome both positive and negative.Individual project risks can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives if they occur. Project Risk Management aims to exploit or enhance positive risks opportunities while avoiding or mitigating negative risks threats. Unmanaged threats may result in issues or problems such as delay cost overruns performance shortfall or loss of reputation. Opportunities that are captured can lead to benefits such as reduced time and cost improved performance or reputation.Overall project risk can also be positive or negative. Management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk exposure within an acceptable range by reducing drivers of negative variation promoting drivers of positive variation and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives. Risks will continue to emerge during the lifetime of the project so Project Risk Management processes should be conducted iteratively. Risk is initially addressed during project planning by shaping the project strategy. Risk should also be monitored and managed as the project progresses to ensure that the project stays on track and emergent risks are addressed.In order to manage risk effectively on a particular project the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. This is defined by measurable risk thresholds that reﬂect the risk appetite of the organization and project stakeholders. Risk thresholds express the degree of acceptable variation around a project objective. They are explicitly stated and communicated to the project team and reﬂected in the definitions of risk impact levels for the project.TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENTThe focus of project risk management is broadening to ensure that all types of risk are considered and that project risks are understood in a wider context. Trends and emerging practices for Project Risk Management include but are not limited to:Non-event risks. Most projects focus only on risks that are uncertain future events that may or may not occur. Examples of event-based risks include: a key seller may go out of business during the project the customer may change the requirement after design is complete or a subcontractor may propose enhancements to the standard operating processes.There is an increasing recognition that non-event risks need to be identified and managed. There are two main types of non-event risks: Variability risk. Uncertainty exists about some key characteristics of a planned event or activity or decision. Examples of variability risks include: productivity may be above or below target the number of errors found during testing may be higher or lower than expected or unseasonal weather conditions may occur during the construction phase. Ambiguity risk. Uncertainty exists about what might happen in the future. Areas of the project where imperfect knowledge might affect the project’s ability to achieve its objectives include: elements of the requirement or technical solution future developments in regulatory frameworks or inherent systemic complexity in the project.Variability risks can be addressed using Monte Carlo analysis with the range of variation reﬂected in probability distributions followed by actions to reduce the spread of possible outcomes. Ambiguity risks are managed by defining those areas where there is a deficit of knowledge or understanding then filling the gap by obtaining expert external input or benchmarking against best practices. Ambiguity is also addressed through incremental development prototyping or simulation.Project resilience. The existence of emergent risk is becoming clear with a growing awareness of so-called unknowable-unknowns. These are risks that can only be recognized after they have occurred. Emergent risks can be tackled through developing project resilience. This requires each project to have: Right level of budget and schedule contingency for emergent risks in addition to a specific risk budget for known risks; Flexible project processes that can cope with emergent risk while maintaining overall direction toward project goals including strong change management; Empowered project team that has clear objectives and that is trusted to get the job done within agreed-upon limits; Frequent review of early warning signs to identify emergent risks as early as possible; and Clear input from stakeholders to clarify areas where the project scope or strategy can be adjusted in response to emergent risks.Integrated risk management. Projects exist in an organizational context and they may form part of a program or portfolio. Risk exists at each of these levels and risks should be owned and managed at the appropriate level. Some risks identified at higher levels will be delegated to the project team for management and some project risks may be escalated to higher levels if they are best managed outside the project. A coordinated approach to enterprise-wide risk management ensures alignment and coherence in the way risk is managed across all levels. This builds risk efficiency into the structure of programs and portfolios providing the greatest overall value for a given level of risk exposure. TAILORING CONSIDERATIONSBecause each project is unique it is necessary to tailor the way Project Risk Management processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:Project size. Does the project’s size in terms of budget duration scope or team size require a more detailed approach to risk management? Or is it small enough to justify a simplified risk process?Project complexity. Is a robust risk approach demanded by high levels of innovation new technology commercial arrangements interfaces or external dependencies that increase project complexity? Or is the project simple enough that a reduced risk process will suffice?Project importance. How strategically important is the project? Is the level of risk increased for this project because it aims to produce breakthrough opportunities addresses significant blocks to organizational performance or involves major product innovation?Development approach. Is this a waterfall project where risk processes can be followed sequentially and iteratively or does the project follow an agile approach where risk is addressed at the start of each iteration as well as during its execution?Tailoring of the Project Risk Management processes to meet these considerations is part of the Plan Risk Management process and the outcomes of tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management plan.CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTSHigh-variability environments by definition incur more uncertainty and risk. To address this projects managed using adaptive approaches make use of frequent reviews of incremental work products and cross-functional project teams to accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed. Risk is considered when selecting the content of each iteration and risks will also be identified analyzed and managed during each iteration.Additionally the requirements are kept as a living document that is updated regularly and work may be reprioritized as the project progresses based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure.,11project risk managementproject risk management includes

Plan Risk Management,11.1 PLAN RISK MANAGEMENTPlan Risk Management is the process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project. The key benefit of this process is that it ensures that the degree type and visibility of risk management are proportionate to both risks and the importance of the project to the organization and other stakeholders. This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs tools and techniques and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 11-2. Figure 11-3 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.Figure 11-2.

Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge or training in the following topics:Familiarity with the organization’s approach to managing risk including enterprise risk management where this is performed;Tailoring risk management to the specific needs of a project; andTypes of risk that are likely to be encountered on projects in the same area.11.1.2.2 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to a stakeholder analysis Section 13.1.2.3 to determine the risk appetite of project stakeholders.11.1.2.3 MEETINGSThe risk management plan may be developed as part of the project kick-off meeting or a specific planning meeting may be held. Attendees may include the project manager selected project team members key stakeholders or team members who are responsible to manage the risk management process on the project. Others outside the organization may also be invited as needed including customers sellers and regulators. A skilled facilitator can help participants remain focused on the task agree on key aspects of the risk approach identify and overcome sources of bias and resolve any disagreements that may arise.Plans for conducting risk management activities are defined in these meetings and documented in the risk management plan see Section 11.1.3.1.,11.1.2 plan risk management: tools techniques11.1.2.1 expert judgmentdescribed section 4.1.2.1. expertise considered individuals groups specialized knowledge training following topics:familiarity organization’s approach managing risk including enterprise risk management performed;tailoring risk management specific needs project; andtypes risk likely encountered projects area.11.1.2.2 data analysisdata analysis techniques used process includes limited stakeholder analysis section 13.1.2.3 determine risk appetite project stakeholders.11.1.2.3 meetingsthe risk management plan may developed part project kick-off meeting specific planning meeting may held. attendees may include project manager selected project team members key stakeholders team members responsible manage risk management process project. others outside organization may also invited needed including customers sellers regulators. skilled facilitator help participants remain focused task agree key aspects risk approach identify overcome sources bias resolve disagreements may arise.plans conducting risk management activities defined meetings documented risk management plan see section 11.1.3.1.,[],"['11.1.2 plan risk management: tool techniques11.1.2.1 expert judgmentdescribed section 4.1.2.1. expertise considered individual group specialized knowledge training following topics:familiarity organization’s approach managing risk including enterprise risk management performed;tailoring risk management specific need project; andtypes risk likely encountered project area.11.1.2.2 data analysisdata analysis technique used process includes limited stakeholder analysis section 13.1.2.3 determine risk appetite project stakeholders.11.1.2.3 meetingsthe risk management plan may developed part project kick-off meeting specific planning meeting may held', 'attendee may include project manager selected project team member key stakeholder team member responsible manage risk management process project', 'others outside organization may also invited needed including customer seller regulator', 'skilled facilitator help participant remain focused task agree key aspect risk approach identify overcome source bias resolve disagreement may arise', 'plan conducting risk management activity defined meeting documented risk management plan see section 11.1.3.1.']","['plan risk management', '11 meetingsthe risk management', 'conducting risk management', 'risk management plan', 'plans conducting risk management', 'risk management process project', 'conducting risk management activities', 'meetingsthe risk management', 'risk management plan developed', 'meetingsthe risk management plan']","['plan risk management', 'risk management plan', 'plans conducting risk management', 'risk management plan developed']","['11 meetingsthe risk management', 'conducting risk management', 'risk management process project', 'conducting risk management activities', 'meetingsthe risk management', 'meetingsthe risk management plan']"
Plan Risk Management Outputs,11.1.3 PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS11.1.3.1 RISK MANAGEMENT PLANThe risk management plan is a component of the project management plan that describes how risk management activities will be structured and performed. The risk management plan may include some or all of the following elements:Risk strategy. Describes the general approach to managing risk on this project.Methodology. Defines the specific approaches tools and data sources that will be used to perform risk management on the project.Roles and responsibilities. Defines the lead support and risk management team members for each type of activity described in the risk management plan and clarifies their responsibilities.Funding. Identifies the funds needed to perform activities related to Project Risk Management. Establishes protocols for the application of contingency and management reserves.Timing. Defines when and how often the Project Risk Management processes will be performed throughout the project life cycle and establishes risk management activities for inclusion into the project schedule.Risk categories. Provide a means for grouping individual project risks. A common way to structure risk categories is with a risk breakdown structure RBS which is a hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk see example in Figure 11-4. An RBS helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual project risks may arise. This can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing identified risks. The organization may have a generic RBS to be used for all projects or there may be several RBS frameworks for different types of projects or the project may develop a tailored RBS. Where an RBS is not used an organization may use a custom risk categorization framework which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a structure based on project objectives.

Extract from Sample Risk Breakdown Structure RBSStakeholder risk appetite. The risk appetites of key stakeholders on the project are recorded in the risk management plan as they inform the details of the Plan Risk Management process. In particular stakeholder risk appetite should be expressed as measurable risk thresholds around each project objective. These thresholds will determine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure and they are also used to inform the definitions of probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks.Definitions of risk probability and impacts. Definitions of risk probability and impact levels are specific to the project context and reﬂect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders. The project may generate specific definitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general definitions provided by the organization. The number of levels reﬂects the degree of detail required for the Project Risk Management process with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach typically five levels and fewer for a simple process usually three. Table 11-1 provides an example of definitions of probability and impacts against three project objectives. These scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact definitions as negative for threats delay additional cost and performance shortfall and positive for opportunities reduced time or cost and performance enhancement.Table 11-1.

Described in Section 11.3.2.6. Prioritization rules may be specified by the organization in advance of the project and be included in organizational process assets or they may be tailored to the specific project. Opportunities and threats are represented in a common probability and impact matrix using positive definitions of impact for opportunities and negative impact definitions for threats. Descriptive terms such as very high high medium low and very low or numeric values can be used for probability and impact. Where numeric values are used these can be multiplied to give a probability-impact score for each risk which allows the relative priority of individual risks to be evaluated within each priority level. An example probability and impact matrix is presented in Figure 11-5 which also shows a possible numeric risk scoring scheme.Figure 11-5. Example Probability and Impact Matrix with Scoring SchemeReporting formats. Reporting formats define how the outcomes of the Project Risk Management process will be documented analyzed and communicated. This section of the risk management plan describes the content and format of the risk register and the risk report as well as any other required outputs from the Project Risk Management processes.Tracking.

Identify Risks,11.2 IDENTIFY RISKSIdentify Risks is the process of identifying individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk and documenting their characteristics. The key benefit of this process is the documentation of existing individual project risks and the sources of overall project risk. It also brings together information so the project team can respond appropriately to identified risks. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs tools and techniques and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 11-6. Figure 11-7 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process. Figure 11-6.

Identify Risks Inputs,11.2.1 IDENTIFY RISKS: INPUTS11.2.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:Requirements management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.2. The requirements management plan may indicate project objectives that are particularly at risk.Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan may identify areas that are subject to uncertainty or ambiguity.Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. The cost management plan may identify areas that are subject to uncertainty or ambiguity.Quality management plan. Described in Section 8.1.3.1. The quality management plan may identify areas that are subject to uncertainty or ambiguity or where key assumptions have been made that might give rise to risk.Resource management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1. The resource management plan may identify areas that are subject to uncertainty or ambiguity or where key assumptions have been made that might give rise to risk. Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. The risk management plan provides information on risk-related roles and responsibilities indicates how risk management activities are included in the budget and schedule and describes categories of risk which may be expressed as a risk breakdown structure Figure 11-4.Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes deliverables and criteria for their acceptance some of which might give rise to risk. It also contains the WBS which can be used as a framework to structure risk identification techniques.Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. The schedule baseline may be reviewed to identify milestones and deliverable due dates that are subject to uncertainty or ambiguity or where key assumptions have been made that might give rise to risk.Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. The cost baseline may be reviewed to identify costs or funding requirements that are subject to uncertainty or ambiguity or where key assumptions have been made that might give rise to risk.11.2.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTSProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may give rise to individual project risks and may also inﬂuence the level of overall project risk.Cost estimates. Described in Section 7.2.3.1.

Identify Risks Tools and Techniques,11.2.2 IDENTIFY RISKS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES11.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENTDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge of similar projects or business areas. Such experts should be identified by the project manager and invited to consider all aspects of individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk based on their previous experience and areas of expertise. The experts’ bias should be taken into account in this process.11.2.2.2 DATA GATHERINGData-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:Brainstorming. The goal of brainstorming see Section 4.1.2.2 is to obtain a comprehensive list of individual project risks and sources of overall project risk. The project team usually performs brainstorming often with a multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the team. Ideas are generated under the guidance of a facilitator either in a free-form brainstorm session or one that uses more structured techniques. Categories of risk such as in a risk breakdown structure can be used as a framework. Particular attention should be paid to ensuring that risks identified through brainstorming are clearly described since the technique can result in ideas that are not fully formed.Checklists. A checklist is a list of items actions or points to be considered. It is often used as a reminder. Risk checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been accumulated from similar projects and from other sources of information. They are an effective way to capture lessons learned from similar completed projects listing specific individual project risks that have occurred previously and that may be relevant to this project. The organization may maintain a risk checklist based on its own completed projects or may use generic risk checklists from the industry. While a checklist may be quick and simple to use it is impossible to build an exhaustive one and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid the effort of proper risk identification. The project team should also explore items that do not appear on the checklist. Additionally the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as remove or archive obsolete information.Interviews. Individual project risks and sources of overall project risk can be identified by interviewing experienced project participants stakeholders and subject matter experts. Interviews see Section 5.2.2.2 should be conducted in an environment of trust and confidentiality to encourage honest and unbiased contributions.11.2.2.3 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:Root cause analysis. Root cause analysis see Section 8.2.2.2 is typically used to discover the underlying causes that lead to a problem and develop preventive action. It can be used to identify threats by starting with a problem statement for example the project might be delayed or over budget and exploring which threats might result in that problem occurring. The same technique can be used to find opportunities by starting with a benefit statement for example early delivery or under budget and exploring which opportunities might result in that benefit being realized.Assumption and constraint analysis. Every project and its project management plan are conceived and developed based on a set of assumptions and within a series of constraints. These are often already incorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates. Assumption and constraint analysis explores the validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project. Threats may be identified from the inaccuracy instability inconsistency or incompleteness of assumptions. Constraints may give rise to opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or process.SWOT analysis. This technique examines the project from each of the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats SWOT perspectives. For risk identification it is used to increase the breadth of identified risks by including internally generated risks. The technique starts with the identification of strengths and weaknesses of the organization focusing on either the project organization or the business area in general. SWOT analysis then identifies any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths and any threats resulting from weaknesses. The analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities.Document analysis. Described in Section 5.2.2.3. Risks may be identified from a structured review of project documents including but not limited to plans assumptions constraints previous project files contracts agreements and technical documentation. Uncertainty or ambiguity in project documents as well as inconsistencies within a document or between different documents may be indicators of risk on the project. 11.2.2.4 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLSInterpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation see Section 4.1.2.3. Facilitation improves the effectiveness of many of the techniques used to identify individual project risks and sources of overall project risk. A skilled facilitator can help participants remain focused on the risk identification task follow the method associated with the technique accurately ensure clear risk descriptions identify and overcome sources of bias and resolve any disagreements that may arise.11.2.2.5 PROMPT LISTSA prompt list is a predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual project risks and that could also act as sources of overall project risk. The prompt list can be used as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation when using risk identification techniques. The risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be used as a prompt list for individual project risks. Some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying sources of overall project risk for example PESTLE political economic social technological legal environmental TECOP technical environmental commercial operational political or VUCA volatility uncertainty complexity ambiguity.11.2.2.6 MEETINGSTo undertake risk identification the project team may conduct a specialized meeting often called a risk workshop. Most risk workshops include some form of brainstorming see Section 4.1.2.2 but other risk identification techniques may be included depending on the level of the risk process defined in the risk management plan. Use of a skilled facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting. It is also essential to ensure that the right people participate in the risk workshop. On larger projects it may be appropriate to invite the project sponsor subject matter experts sellers representatives of the customer or other project stakeholders. Risk workshops for smaller projects may be restricted to a subset of the project team.,11.2.2 identify risks: tools techniques11.2.2.1 expert judgmentdescribed section 4.1.2.1. expertise considered

Identify Risks Outputs,11.2.3 IDENTIFY RISKS: OUTPUTS11.2.3.1 RISK REGISTERThe risk register captures details of identified individual project risks. The results of Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Plan Risk Responses Implement Risk Responses and Monitor Risks are recorded in the risk register as those processes are conducted throughout the project. The risk register may contain limited or extensive risk information depending on project variables such as size and complexity.On completion of the Identify Risks process the content of the risk register may include but is not limited to:List of identified risks. Each individual project risk is given a unique identifier in the risk register. Identified risks are described in as much detail as required to ensure unambiguous understanding. A structured risk statement may be used to distinguish risks from their causes and their effects.Potential risk owners. Where a potential risk owner has been identified during the Identify Risks process the risk owner is recorded in the risk register. This will be confirmed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process.List of potential risk responses. Where a potential risk response has been identified during the Identify Risks process it is recorded in the risk register. This will be confirmed during the Plan Risk Responses process.Additional data may be recorded for each identified risk depending on the risk register format specified in the risk management plan. This may include: a short risk title risk category current risk status one or more causes one or more effects on objectives risk triggers events or conditions that indicate that a risk is about to occur WBS reference of affected activities and timing information when was the risk identified when might the risk occur when might it no longer be relevant and what is the deadline for taking action. 11.2.3.2 RISK REPORTThe risk report presents information on sources of overall project risk together with summary information on identified individual project risks. The risk report is developed progressively throughout the Project Risk Management process.

Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis,11.3 PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSISPerform Qualitative Risk Analysis is the process of prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis or action by assessing their probability of occurrence and impact as well as other characteristics. The key benefit of this process is that it focuses efforts on high-priority risks. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs tools and techniques and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 11-8. Figure 11-9 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.Figure 11-8.

Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis: Data Flow DiagramPerform Qualitative Risk Analysis assesses the priority of identified individual project risks using their probability of occurrence the corresponding impact on project objectives if the risks occur and other factors. Such assessments are subjective as they are based on perceptions of risk by the project team and other stakeholders. Effective assessment therefore requires explicit identification and management of the risk attitudes of key participants in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. Risk perception introduces bias into the assessment of identified risks so attention should be paid to identifying bias and correcting for it. Where a facilitator is used to support the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process addressing bias is a key part of the facilitator’s role.

Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Inputs,11.3.1 PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS: INPUTS11.3.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include the risk management plan as described in Section 11.1.3.1. Of particular interest in this process are the roles and responsibilities for conducting risk management budgets for risk management schedule activities for risk management risk categories often defined in a risk breakdown structure definitions of probability and impact the probability and impact matrix and stakeholders’ risk thresholds. These inputs are usually tailored to the project during the Plan Risk Management process. If they are not available they may be developed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process and presented to the project sponsor for approval before use.11.3.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTSProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log is used for identifying managing and monitoring key assumptions and constraints that may affect the project. These may inform the assessment of the priority of individual project risks.Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register contains details of each identified individual project risk that will be assessed during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process.Stakeholder register.

Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Tools and Techniques,11.3.2 PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES11.3.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENTDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge or training in the following topics:Previous similar projects andQualitative risk analysis.Expert judgment is often obtained through facilitated risk workshops or interviews. The possibility of expert views being biased should be taken into account in this process.11.3.2.2 DATA GATHERINGData-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to interviews. Structured or semi-structured interviews Section 5.2.2.2 can be used to assess the probability and impacts of individual project risks as well as other factors. The interviewer should promote an environment of trust and confidentiality in the interview setting to encourage honest and unbiased assessments.11.3.2.3 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to:Risk data quality assessment. Risk data quality assessment evaluates the degree to which the data about individual project risks is accurate and reliable as a basis for qualitative risk analysis. The use of low-quality risk data may lead to a qualitative risk analysis that is of little use to the project. If data quality is unacceptable it may be necessary to gather better data. Risk data quality may be assessed via a questionnaire measuring the project’s stakeholder perceptions of various characteristics which may include completeness objectivity relevancy and timeliness. A weighted average of selected data quality characteristics can then be generated to give an overall quality score.Risk probability and impact assessment. Risk probability assessment considers the likelihood that a specific risk will occur. Risk impact assessment considers the potential effect on one or more project objectives such as schedule cost quality or performance. Impacts will be negative for threats and positive for opportunities. Probability and impact are assessed for each identified individual project risk. Risks can be assessed in interviews or meetings with participants selected for their familiarity with the types of risk recorded in the risk register. Project team members and knowledgeable persons external to the project are included. The level of probability for each risk and its impact on each objective are evaluated during the interview or meeting. Differences in the levels of probability and impact perceived by stakeholders are to be expected and such differences should be explored. Explanatory detail including assumptions justifying the levels assigned are also recorded. Risk probabilities and impacts are assessed using the definitions given in the risk management plan see Table 11-1. Risks with low probability and impact may be included within the risk register as part of a watch list for future monitoring.Assessment of other risk parameters. The project team may consider other characteristics of risk in addition to probability and impact when prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis and action. These characteristics may include but are not limited to:  Urgency. The period of time within which a response to the risk is to be implemented in order to be effective. A short period indicates high urgency. Proximity. The period of time before the risk might have an impact on one or more project objectives. A short period indicates high proximity. Dormancy. The period of time that may elapse after a risk has occurred before its impact is discovered. A short period indicates low dormancy. Manageability. The ease with which the risk owner or owning organization can manage the occurrence or impact of a risk. Where management is easy manageability is high. Controllability. The degree to which the risk owner or owning organization is able to control the risk’s outcome. Where the outcome can be easily controlled controllability is high. Detectability. The ease with which the results of the risk occurring or being about to occur can be detected and recognized. Where the risk occurrence can be detected easily detectability is high. Connectivity. The extent to which the risk is related to other individual project risks. Where a risk is connected to many other risks connectivity is high. Strategic impact. The potential for the risk to have a positive or negative effect on the organization’s strategic goals. Where the risk has a major effect on strategic goals strategic impact is high. Propinquity. The degree to which a risk is perceived to matter by one or more stakeholders. Where a risk is perceived as very significant propinquity is high.The consideration of some of these characteristics can provide a more robust prioritization of risks than is possible by only assessing probability and impact.11.3.2.4 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLSInterpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to facilitation see Section 4.1.2.3. Facilitation improves the effectiveness of the qualitative analysis of individual project risks. A skilled facilitator can help participants remain focused on the risk analysis task follow the method associated with the technique accurately reach consensus on assessments of probability and impacts identify and overcome sources of bias and resolve any disagreements that may arise.11.3.2.5 RISK CATEGORIZATIONRisks to the project can be categorized by sources of risk e.g. using the risk breakdown structure RBS; see Figure 11-4 the area of the project affected e.g. using the work breakdown structure WBS; see Figures 5-12 5-13 and 5-14 or other useful categories e.g. project phase project budget and roles and responsibilities to determine the areas of the project most exposed to the effects of uncertainty. Risks can also be categorized by common root causes. Risk categories that may be used for the project are defined in the risk management plan.Grouping risks into categories can lead to the development of more effective risk responses by focusing attention and effort on the areas of highest risk exposure or by developing generic risk responses to address groups of related risks.11.3.2.6 DATA REPRESENTATIONData representation techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to:Probability and impact matrix. A probability and impact matrix is a grid for mapping the probability of each risk occurrence and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs. This matrix specifies combinations of probability and impact that allow individual project risks to be divided into priority groups see Figure 11-5. Risks can be prioritized for further analysis and planning of risk responses based on their probability and impacts. The probability of occurrence for each individual project risk is assessed as well as its impact on one or more project objectives if it does occur using definitions of probability and impact for the project as specified in the risk management plan. Individual project risks are assigned to a priority level based on the combination of their assessed probability and impact using a probability and impact matrix.An organization can assess a risk separately for each objective e.g. cost time and scope by having a separate probability and impact matrix for each. Alternatively it may develop ways to determine one overall priority level for each risk either by combining assessments for different objectives or by taking the highest priority level regardless of which objective is affected.Hierarchical charts. Where risks have been categorized using more than two parameters the probability and impact matrix cannot be used and other graphical representations are required. For example a bubble chart displays three dimensions of data where each risk is plotted as a disk bubble and the three parameters are represented by the x-axis value the y-axis value and the bubble size. An example bubble chart is shown in Figure 11-10 with detectability and proximity plotted on the x and y axes and impact value represented by bubble size. Figure 11-10. Example Bubble Chart Showing Detectability Proximity and Impact Value11.3.2.7 MEETINGSTo undertake qualitative risk analysis the project team may conduct a specialized meeting often called a risk workshop dedicated to the discussion of identified individual project risks. The goals of this meeting include the review of previously identified risks assessment of probability and impacts and possibly other risk parameters categorization and prioritization. A risk owner who will be responsible for planning an appropriate risk response and for reporting progress on managing the risk will be allocated to each individual project risk as part of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. The meeting may start by reviewing and confirming the probability and impact scales to be used for the analysis. The meeting may also identify additional risks during the discussion and these should be recorded for analysis. Use of a skilled facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting.ProximityHighLowLowHighDetectabilityLargebubblesin thisarea areunacceptableBubble size = Impact ValueSmall bubblesin this

Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis,11.4 PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSISPerform Quantitative Risk Analysis is the process of numerically analyzing the combined effect of identified individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty on overall project objectives. The key benefit of this process is that it quantifies overall project risk exposure and it can also provide additional quantitative risk information to support risk response planning. This process is not required for every project but where it is used it is performed throughout the project. The inputs and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 11-11. Figure 11-12 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.Figure 11-11.

Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis: Data Flow DiagramPerform Quantitative Risk Analysis is not required for all projects. Undertaking a robust analysis depends on the availability of high-quality data about individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty as well as a sound underlying project baseline for scope schedule and cost. Quantitative risk analysis usually requires specialized risk software and expertise in the development and interpretation of risk models. It also consumes additional time and cost. The use of quantitative risk analysis for a project will be specified in the project’s risk management plan. It is most likely appropriate for large or complex projects strategically important projects projects for which it is a contractual requirement or projects in which a key stakeholder requires it. Quantitative risk analysis is the only reliable method to assess overall project risk through evaluating the aggregated effect on project outcomes of all individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty.Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis uses information on individual project risks that have been assessed by the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process as having a significant potential to affect the project’s objectives.Outputs from Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis are used as inputs to the Plan Risk Responses process particularly in recommending responses to the level of overall project risk and key individual risks. A quantitative risk analysis may also be undertaken following the Plan Risk Responses process to determine the likely effectiveness of planned responses in reducing overall project risk exposure.,11.4

Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis Tools and Techniques,11.4.2 PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES11.4.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENTDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge or training in the following topics:Translating information on individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty into numeric inputs for the quantitative risk analysis modelSelecting the most appropriate representation of uncertainty to model particular risks or other sources of uncertaintyModeling techniques that are appropriate in the context of the projectIdentifying which tools would be most suitable for the selected modeling techniques andInterpreting the outputs of quantitative risk analysis. 11.4.2.2 DATA GATHERINGInterviews see Section 5.2.2.2 may be used to generate inputs for the quantitative risk analysis drawing on inputs that include individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty. This is particularly useful where information is required from experts. The interviewer should promote an environment of trust and confidentiality during the interview to encourage honest and unbiased contributions.11.4.2.3 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLSInterpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to facilitation see Section 4.1.2.3. A skilled facilitator is useful for gathering input data during a dedicated risk workshop involving project team members and other stakeholders. Facilitated workshops can improve effectiveness by establishing a clear understanding of the purpose of the workshop building consensus among participants ensuring continued focus on the task and using creative approaches to deal with interpersonal conﬂict or sources of bias.11.4.2.4 REPRESENTATIONS OF UNCERTAINTYQuantitative risk analysis requires inputs to a quantitative risk analysis model that reﬂect individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty.Where the duration cost or resource requirement for a planned activity is uncertain the range of possible values can be represented in the model as a probability distribution. This may take several forms. The most commonly used are triangular normal lognormal beta uniform or discrete distributions. Care should be taken when selecting an appropriate probability distribution to reﬂect the range of possible values for the planned activity.Individual project risks may be covered by probability distributions. Alternatively risks may be included in the model as probabilistic branches where optional activities are added to the model to represent the time and/or cost impact of the risk should it occur and the chance that these activities actually occur in a particular simulation run matches the risk’s probability. Branches are most useful for risks that might occur independently of any planned activity. Where risks are related for example with a common cause or a logical dependency correlation is used in the model to indicate this relationship.Other sources of uncertainty may also be represented using branches to describe alternative paths through the project.11.4.2.5 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to:Simulation. Quantitative risk analysis uses a model that simulates the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. Simulations are typically performed using a Monte Carlo analysis. When running a Monte Carlo analysis for cost risk the simulation uses the project cost estimates. When running a Monte Carlo analysis for schedule risk the schedule network diagram and duration estimates are used. An integrated quantitative cost-schedule risk analysis uses both inputs. The output is a quantitative risk analysis model.Computer software is used to iterate the quantitative risk analysis model several thousand times. The input values e.g. cost estimates duration estimates or occurrence of probabilistic branches are chosen at random for each iteration. Outputs represent the range of possible outcomes for the project e.g. project end date project cost at completion. Typical outputs include a histogram presenting the number of iterations where a particular outcome resulted from the simulation or a cumulative probability distribution S-curve representing the probability of achieving any particular outcome or less. An example S-curve from a Monte Carlo cost risk analysis is shown in Figure 11-13.Figure 11-13.

A criticality index is calculated for each element in the risk model which gives the frequency with which that element appears on the critical path during the simulation usually expressed as a percentage. The output from a criticality analysis allows the project team to focus risk response planning efforts on those activities with the highest potential effect on the overall schedule performance of the project.Sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis helps to determine which individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes. It correlates variations in project outcomes with variations in elements of the quantitative risk analysis model.One typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram which presents the calculated correlation coefficient for each element of the quantitative risk analysis model that can inﬂuence the project outcome. This can include individual project risks project activities with high degrees of variability or specific sources of ambiguity. Items are ordered by descending strength of correlation giving the typical tornado appearance.  An example tornado diagram is shown in Figure 11-14.Figure 11-14.

Decision trees are used to support selection of the best of several alternative courses of action. Alternative paths through the project are shown in the decision tree using branches representing different decisions or events each of which can have associated costs and related individual project risks including both threats and opportunities. The end-points of branches in the decision tree represent the outcome from following that particular path which can be negative or positive.The decision tree is evaluated by calculating the expected monetary value of each branch allowing the optimal path to be selected. An example decision tree is shown in Figure 11-15.Figure 11-15.

For each decision the demand which is uncertain and therefore represents a“chance node” must be accounted for. For example strong demand leads to $M revenue with the new plantbut only $M US for the upgraded plant perhaps due to capacity limitations of the upgraded plant. The end of each branch shows the net effect of the payoffs minus costs. For each decision branch all effects are added seeshaded areas to determine the overall Expected Monetary Value EMV of the decision. Remember to account forthe investment costs. From the calculations in the shaded areas the upgraded plant has a higher EMV of $46M – also the EMV of the overall decision. This choice also represents the lowest risk avoiding the worst case possible outcome of a loss of $30M.Decision NodeChance NodeEnd of BranchStrong Demand$MWeak Demand$90MStrong Demand$MWeak

Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis Outputs,11.4.3 PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS: OUTPUTS11.4.3.1 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATESProject documents that can be considered as outputs for this process include but are not limited to the risk report described in Section 11.2.3.2. The risk report will be updated to reﬂect the results of the quantitative risk analysis. This will typically include:Assessment of overall project risk exposure. Overall project risk is reﬂected in two key measures: Chances of project success indicated by the probability that the project will achieve its key objectives e.g. required end date or interim milestones required cost target etc. given the identified individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty; and Degree of inherent variability remaining within the project at the time the analysis was conducted indicated by the range of possible project outcomes.Detailed probabilistic analysis of the project. Key outputs from the quantitative risk analysis are presented such as S-curves tornado diagrams and criticality analysis together with a narrative interpretation of the results. Possible detailed results of a quantitative risk analysis may include: Amount of contingency reserve needed to provide a specified level of confidence; Identification of individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty that have the greatest effect on the project critical path; and Major drivers of overall project risk with the greatest inﬂuence on uncertainty in project outcomes.Prioritized list of individual project risks. This list includes those individual project risks that pose the greatest threat or present the greatest opportunity to the project as indicated by sensitivity analysis.Trends in quantitative risk analysis results.

Plan Risk Responses,11.5 PLAN RISK RESPONSESPlan Risk Responses is the process of developing options selecting strategies and agreeing on actions to address overall project risk exposure as well as to treat individual project risks. The key benefit of this process is that it identifies appropriate ways to address overall project risk and individual project risks. This process also allocates resources and inserts activities into project documents and the project management plan as needed. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs tools and techniques and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 11-16.  Figure 11-17 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.Figure 11-16.

Plan Risk Responses Inputs,11.5.1 PLAN RISK RESPONSES: INPUTS11.5.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:Resource management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1. The resource management plan is used to help determine how resources allocated to agreed-upon risk responses will be coordinated with other project resources.Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. Risk management roles and responsibilities and risk thresholds are used in this process.Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. The cost baseline has information on the contingency fund that is allocated to respond to risks. 11.5.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTSProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned about effective risk responses used in earlier phases of the project are reviewed to determine if similar responses might be useful during the remainder of the project.Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The schedule is used to determine how agreed-upon risk responses will be scheduled alongside other project activities.Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.2. Project team assignments can show the resources that can be allocated to agreed-upon risk responses.Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars identify when potential resources are available to be allocated to agreed-upon risk responses.Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register contains details of individual project risks that have been identified and prioritized and for which risk responses are required. The priority level for each risk can help to guide the selection of appropriate risk responses. For example high-priority threats or opportunities may require priority action and highly proactive response strategies. Threats and opportunities in the low-priority zone may not require proactive management action beyond being placed in the risk register as part of the watch list or adding a contingency reserve.The risk register identifies the nominated risk owner for each risk. It may also contain preliminary risk responses identified earlier in the Project Risk Management process. The risk register may provide other data on identified risks that can assist in planning risk responses including root causes risk triggers and warning signs risks requiring responses in the near term and risks where a need for additional analysis has been identified.Risk report. Described in Section 11.2.3.2. The risk report presents the current level of overall risk exposure of the project that will inform selection of the risk response strategy. The risk report may also list individual project risks in priority order and provide additional analysis of the distribution of individual project risks that may inform risk response selection.Stakeholder register. Described in Section 13.1.3.1. The stakeholder register identifies potential owners for risk responses.,11.5.1 plan risk responses: inputs11.5.1.1 project management plandescribed section 4.2.3.1. project management plan components

Plan Risk Responses Tools and Techniques,11.5.2 PLAN RISK RESPONSES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES11.5.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENTDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge in the following topics:Threat response strategiesOpportunity response strategiesContingent response strategies andOverall project risk response strategies.Expert input may be sought from individuals with particular subject matter expertise relevant to a specific individual project risk for example where specialist technical knowledge is required. 11.5.2.2 DATA GATHERINGData-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to interviews see Section 5.2.2.2. Development of responses to individual project risks and overall project risk may be undertaken during structured or semi-structured interviews see Section 5.2.2.2 with risk owners. Other stakeholders may also be interviewed if necessary. The interviewer should promote an environment of trust and confidentiality in the interview setting to encourage honest and unbiased decisions.11.5.2.3 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLSInterpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation see Section 4.1.2.3. The use of facilitation improves the effectiveness of developing responses to individual project risks and overall project risk. A skilled facilitator can help risk owners understand the risk identify and compare alternative possible risk response strategies choose an appropriate response strategy and identify and overcome sources of bias.11.5.2.4 STRATEGIES FOR THREATSFive alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with threats as follows:Escalate. Escalation is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that a threat is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project manager’s authority. Escalated risks are managed at the program level portfolio level or other relevant part of the organization and not on the project level. The project manager determines who should be notified about the threat and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization. It is important that ownership of escalated threats is accepted by the relevant party in the organization. Threats are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the threat occurred. Escalated threats are not monitored further by the project team after escalation although they may be recorded in the risk register for information.Avoid. Risk avoidance is when the project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its impact. It may be appropriate for high-priority threats with a high probability of occurrence and a large negative impact. Avoidance may involve changing some aspect of the project management plan or changing the objective that is in jeopardy in order to eliminate the threat entirely reducing its probability of occurrence to zero. The risk owner may also take action to isolate the project objectives from the risk’s impact if it were to occur. Examples of avoidance actions may include removing the cause of a threat extending the schedule changing the project strategy or reducing scope. Some risks can be avoided by clarifying requirements obtaining information improving communication or acquiring expertise.Transfer. Transfer involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and to bear the impact if the threat occurs. Risk transfer often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the threat. Transfer can be achieved by a range of actions which include but are not limited to the use of insurance performance bonds warranties guarantees etc. Agreements may be used to transfer ownership and liability for specified risks to another party.Mitigate. In risk mitigation action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or impact of a threat. Early mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the threat has occurred. Adopting less complex processes conducting more tests or choosing a more stable seller are examples of mitigation actions. Mitigation may involve prototype development see Section 5.2.2.8 to reduce the risk of scaling up from a bench-scale model of a process or product. Where it is not possible to reduce probability a mitigation response might reduce the impact by targeting factors that drive the severity. For example designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component.Accept. Risk acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat but no proactive action is taken. This strategy may be appropriate for low-priority threats and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address a threat in any other way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve including amounts of time money or resources to handle the threat if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly. 11.5.2.5 STRATEGIES FOR OPPORTUNITIESFive alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with opportunities as follows:Escalate. This risk response strategy is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that an opportunity is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project manager’s authority. Escalated opportunities are managed at the program level portfolio level or other relevant part of the organization and not on the project level. The project manager determines who should be notified about the opportunity and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization. It is important that ownership of escalated opportunities is accepted by the relevant party in the organization. Opportunities are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the opportunity occurred. Escalated opportunities are not monitored further by the project team after escalation although they may be recorded in the risk register for information.Exploit. The exploit strategy may be selected for high-priority opportunities where the organization wants to ensure that the opportunity is realized. This strategy seeks to capture the benefit associated with a particular opportunity by ensuring that it definitely happens increasing the probability of occurrence to %. Examples of exploiting responses may include assigning an organization’s most talented resources to the project to reduce the time to completion or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration.Share. Sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party so that it shares some of the benefit if the opportunity occurs. It is important to select the new owner of a shared opportunity carefully so they are best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project. Risk sharing often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the opportunity. Examples of sharing actions include forming risk-sharing partnerships teams special-purpose companies or joint ventures.Enhance. The enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or impact of an opportunity. Early enhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the benefit after the opportunity has occurred. The probability of occurrence of an opportunity may be increased by focusing attention on its causes. Where it is not possible to increase probability an enhancement response might increase the impact by targeting factors that drive the size of the potential benefit. Examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources to an activity to finish early.Accept. Accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but no proactive action is taken. This strategy may be appropriate for low-priority opportunities and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address an opportunity in any other way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve including amounts of time money or resources to take advantage of the opportunity if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the opportunity to ensure that it does not change significantly.11.5.2.6 CONTINGENT RESPONSE STRATEGIESSome responses are designed for use only if certain events occur. For some risks it is appropriate for the project team to make a response plan that will only be executed under certain predefined conditions if it is believed that there will be sufficient warning to implement the plan. Events that trigger the contingency response such as missing intermediate milestones or gaining higher priority with a seller should be defined and tracked. Risk responses identified using this technique are often called contingency plans or fallback plans and include identified triggering events that set the plans in effect.11.5.2.7 STRATEGIES FOR OVERALL PROJECT RISKRisk responses should be planned and implemented not only for individual project risks but also to address overall project risk. The same risk response strategies that are used to deal with individual project risks can also be applied to overall project risk:Avoid. Where the level of overall project risk is significantly negative and outside the agreed-upon risk thresholds for the project an avoid strategy may be adopted. This involves taking focused action to reduce the negative effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole and bring the project back within the thresholds. An example of avoidance at the overall project level would include removal of high-risk elements of scope from the project. Where it is not possible to bring the project back within the thresholds the project may be canceled. This represents the most extreme degree of risk avoidance and it should be used only if the overall level of threat is and will remain unacceptable.Exploit. Where the level of overall project risk is significantly positive and outside the agreed-upon risk thresholds for the project an exploit strategy may be adopted. This involves taking focused action to capture the positive effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. An example of exploiting at the overall project level would include addition of high-benefit elements of scope to the project to add value or benefits to stakeholders. Alternatively the risk thresholds for the project may be modified with the agreement of key stakeholders in order to embrace the opportunity.Transfer/share. If the level of overall project risk is high but the organization is unable to address it effectively a third party may be involved to manage the risk on behalf of the organization. Where overall project risk is negative a transfer strategy is required which may involve payment of a risk premium. In the case of high positive overall project risk ownership may be shared in order to reap the associated benefits. Examples of both transfer and share strategies for overall project risk include but are not limited to setting up a collaborative business structure in which the buyer and the seller share the overall project risk launching a joint venture or special-purpose company or subcontracting key elements of the project. Mitigate/enhance. These strategies involve changing the level of overall project risk to optimize the chances of achieving the project’s objectives. The mitigation strategy is used where overall project risk is negative and enhancement applies when it is positive. Examples of mitigation or enhancement strategies include replanning the project changing the scope and boundaries of the project modifying project priority changing resource allocations adjusting delivery times etc.Accept. Where no proactive risk response strategy is possible to address overall project risk the organization may choose to continue with the project as currently defined even if overall project risk is outside the agreed-upon thresholds. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish an overall contingency reserve for the project including amounts of time money or resources to be used if the project exceeds its thresholds. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the level of overall project risk to ensure that it does not change significantly.11.5.2.8 DATA ANALYSISA number of alternative risk response strategies may be considered. Data analysis techniques that can be used to select a preferred risk response strategy include but are not limited to:Alternatives analysis. A simple comparison of the characteristics and requirements of alternative risk response options can lead to a decision on which response is most appropriate.Cost-benefit analysis. If the impact of an individual project risk can be quantified in monetary terms then the cost-effectiveness of alternative risk response strategies can be determined using cost-benefit analysis see Section 8.1.2.3. The ratio of change in impact level divided by implementation cost gives the cost effectiveness of the response strategy with a higher ratio indicating a more effective response.11.5.2.9 DECISION MAKINGDecision-making techniques that can be used to select a risk response strategy include but are not limited to multicriteria decision analysis described in Section 8.1.2.4. One or more risk response strategies may be under consideration. Decision-making techniques can help prioritize risk response strategies. Multicriteria decision analysis uses a decision matrix to provide a systematic approach for establishing key decision criteria evaluating and ranking alternatives and selecting a preferred option. Criteria for risk response selection may include but are not limited to cost of response likely effectiveness of response in changing probability and/or impact resource availability timing constraints urgency proximity and dormancy level of impact if the risk occurs effect of response on related risks introduction of secondary risks etc. Different strategies may be selected later in the project if the original choice proves to be ineffective.,11.5.2 plan risk responses: tools techniques11.5.2.1 expert judgmentdescribed section 4.1.2.1. expertise considered individuals groups specialized

Monitor Risks,11.7 MONITOR RISKSMonitor Risks is the process of monitoring the implementation of agreed-upon risk response plans tracking identified risks identifying and analyzing new risks and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project. The key benefit of this process is that it enables project decisions to be based on current information about overall project risk exposure and individual project risks. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs tools and techniques and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 11-20. Figure 11-21 depicts the data ﬂow diagram for the process.Figure 11-20.

Project management plan components include but are not limited to the risk management plan. Described in Section 11.3.1.1. The risk management plan provides guidance on how and when risks should be reviewed which policies and procedures should be followed the roles and responsibilities in the monitoring process and reporting formats.11.7.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTSProject documents that should be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:Issue log. Described in Section 4.3.3.3. The issue log is used to see if any of the open issues have been updated and necessitate an update to the risk register.Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Risk-related lessons from earlier in the project can be applied to later phases in the project.Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register has key inputs that include identified individual project risks risk owners agreed-upon risk responses and specific implementation actions. It may also provide other details including control actions for assessing the effectiveness of response plans symptoms and warning signs of risk residual and secondary risks and a watch list of low-priority risks.Risk report. Described in Section 11.2.3.2. The risk report includes an assessment of the current overall project risk exposure as well as the agreed-upon risk response strategy. It also describes the major individual risks with planned responses and risk owners.,11.7.1 monitor risks: inputs11.7.1.1 project management plandescribed section 4.2.3.1. project management plan components include limited risk management plan. described section 11.3.1.1. risk management plan provides guidance risks reviewed policies procedures followed roles responsibilities monitoring process reporting formats.11.7.1.2 project documentsproject documents considered inputs process include limited to:issue log. described section 4.3.3.3. issue log used see open issues updated necessitate update risk register.lessons learned register. described section 4.4.3.1. risk-related lessons earlier project applied later phases project.risk register. described section 11.2.3.1. risk register key inputs include identified individual project risks risk owners agreed-upon risk responses specific implementation actions. may also provide details including control actions assessing effectiveness response plans symptoms warning signs risk residual secondary risks watch list low-priority risks.risk report. described section 11.2.3.2. risk report includes assessment current overall project risk exposure well agreed-upon risk response strategy. also describes major individual risks planned responses risk owners.,[],"['11.7.1 monitor risks: inputs11.7.1.1 project management plandescribed section 4.2.3.1. project management plan component include limited risk management plan', 'described section 11.3.1.1. risk management plan provides guidance risk reviewed policy procedure followed role responsibility monitoring process reporting formats.11.7.1.2 project documentsproject document considered input process include limited to:issue log', 'described section 4.3.3.3. issue log used see open issue updated necessitate update risk register', 'lesson learned register', 'described section 4.4.3.1. risk-related lesson earlier project applied later phase project', 'risk register', 'described section 11.2.3.1. risk register key input include identified individual project risk risk owner agreed-upon risk response specific implementation action', 'may also provide detail including control action assessing effectiveness response plan symptom warning sign risk residual secondary risk watch list low-priority risk', 'risk report', 'described section 11.2.3.2. risk report includes assessment current overall project risk exposure well agreed-upon risk response strategy', 'also describes major individual risk planned response risk owner']","['project risk exposure', 'project risk register described', 'project risks', 'project risks risk', 'project risk register', 'phases project risk register', 'project risk exposure agreed', 'overall project risk exposure', 'risks inputs11 project management', 'project risk']",[],"['project risk exposure', 'project risk register described', 'project risks', 'project risks risk', 'project risk register', 'phases project risk register', 'project risk exposure agreed', 'overall project risk exposure', 'risks inputs11 project management', 'project risk']"
Monitor Risks Tools and Techniques,11.7.2 MONITOR RISKS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES11.7.2.1 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:Technical performance analysis. Technical performance analysis compares technical accomplishments during project execution to the schedule of technical achievement. It requires the definition of objective quantifiable measures of technical performance which can be used to compare actual results against targets. Such technical performance measures may include weight transaction times number of delivered defects storage capacity etc. Deviation can indicate the potential impact of threats or opportunities.Reserve analysis. Described in Section 7.2.2.6. Throughout execution of the project some individual project risks may occur with positive or negative impacts on budget or schedule contingency reserves. Reserve analysis compares the amount of the contingency reserves remaining to the amount of risk remaining at any time in the project in order to determine if the remaining reserve is adequate. This may be communicated using various graphical representations including a burndown chart.11.7.2.2 AUDITSDescribed in Section 8.2.2.5. Risk audits are a type of audit that may be used to consider the effectiveness of the risk management process. The project manager is responsible for ensuring that risk audits are performed at an appropriate frequency as defined in the project’s risk management plan. Risk audits may be included during routine project review meetings or may form part of a risk review meeting or the team may choose to hold separate risk audit meetings. The format for the risk audit and its objectives should be clearly defined before the audit is conducted.,11.7.2 monitor risks: tools techniques11.7.2.1 data analysisdata analysis techniques used process include limited to:technical performance analysis. technical performance analysis compares technical accomplishments project execution schedule technical achievement. requires definition objective quantifiable measures technical performance used compare actual results targets. technical performance measures may include weight transaction times number delivered defects storage capacity etc. deviation indicate potential impact threats opportunities.reserve analysis. described section 7.2.2.6. throughout execution project individual project risks may occur positive negative impacts budget schedule contingency reserves. reserve analysis compares amount contingency reserves remaining amount risk remaining time project order determine remaining reserve adequate. may communicated using various graphical representations including burndown chart.11.7.2.2 auditsdescribed section 8.2.2.5. risk audits type audit may used consider effectiveness risk management process. project manager responsible ensuring risk audits performed appropriate frequency defined project’s risk management plan. risk audits may included routine project review meetings may form part risk review meeting team may choose hold separate risk audit meetings. format risk audit objectives clearly defined audit conducted.,[],"['11.7.2 monitor risks: tool techniques11.7.2.1 data analysisdata analysis technique used process include limited to:technical performance analysis', 'technical performance analysis compare technical accomplishment project execution schedule technical achievement', 'requires definition objective quantifiable measure technical performance used compare actual result target', 'technical performance measure may include weight transaction time number delivered defect storage capacity etc', 'deviation indicate potential impact threat opportunity', 'reserve analysis', 'described section 7.2.2.6. throughout execution project individual project risk may occur positive negative impact budget schedule contingency reserve', 'reserve analysis compare amount contingency reserve remaining amount risk remaining time project order determine remaining reserve adequate', 'may communicated using various graphical representation including burndown chart.11.7.2.2 auditsdescribed section 8.2.2.5. risk audit type audit may used consider effectiveness risk management process', 'project manager responsible ensuring risk audit performed appropriate frequency defined project’s risk management plan', 'risk audit may included routine project review meeting may form part risk review meeting team may choose hold separate risk audit meeting', 'format risk audit objective clearly defined audit conducted']","['defined project risk management', 'project risk management', 'project risks', 'project risks occur', 'risk management process project', 'monitor risks tools techniques11', 'defined project risk', 'project risk management plan', 'risks tools techniques11', 'project risk']","['monitor risks tools techniques11', 'risks tools techniques11']","['defined project risk management', 'project risk management', 'project risks', 'project risks occur', 'risk management process project', 'defined project risk', 'project risk management plan', 'project risk']"
Monitor Risks Outputs,11.7.3 MONITOR RISKS: OUTPUTS11.7.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATIONDescribed in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how project risk management is performing by comparing the individual risks that have occurred with the expectation of how they would occur. This information indicates the effectiveness of the response planning and response implementation processes.11.7.3.2 CHANGE REQUESTSDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. The Monitor Risks process may result in a change request to the cost and schedule baselines or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process Section 4.6.Change requests can include recommended corrective and preventive actions to address the current level of overall project risk or to address individual project risks.11.7.3.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATESAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change request. This may affect any component of the project management plan. 11.7.3.4 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATESProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. During the Monitor Risks process new assumptions may be made new constraints may be identified and existing assumptions or constraints may be revisited and changed. The assumption log is updated with this new information.Issue log. Described in Section 4.3.3.3. Where issues are identified as part of the Monitor Risks process these are recorded in the issue log.Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register is updated with any risk-related lessons learned during risk reviews so these can be used on later phases of the project or in future projects.Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register is updated with information on individual project risks generated during the Monitor Risks process. This may include adding new risks updating outdated risks or risks that were realized updating risk responses and so forth.Risk report. Described in Section 11.2.3.2. As new information becomes available through the Monitor Risks process the risk report is updated to reﬂect the current status of major individual project risks and the current level of overall project risk. The risk report may also include details of the top individual project risks agreed-upon responses and owners and conclusions and recommendations. It may also include conclusions from risk audits on the effectiveness of the risk management process.11.7.3.5 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS UPDATESOrganizational process assets that are updated as a result of the Monitor Risks process include but are not limited to:Templates for the risk management plan risk register and risk report;

 INTRODUCTION,"Project Management Institute PMI practice standards are guides to the use of a tool, technique, or process identified in A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition or other PMI standards. Practice standards are targeted at audiences who participate in the management of projects. This includes project managers, project personnel, contract personnel, supervisors, and other project stakeholders. A PMI practice standard describes processes, activities, inputs, and outputs for a specific Knowledge Area. It provides information on what the significant process, tool, or technique is, what it does, why it is significant, when it should be performed or executed, and, if necessary for further clarification, who should perform the process. A practice standard does not prescribe how the process is to be implemented, leaving that subject for other forums such as handbooks, manuals, and courses.",project management institute pmi practice standards guides use tool technique process identified guide project management body knowledge pmbok guide fourth edition pmi standards. practice standards targeted audiences participate management projects. includes project managers project personnel contract personnel supervisors project stakeholders. pmi practice standard describes processes activities inputs outputs specific knowledge area. provides information significant process tool technique significant performed executed necessary clarification perform process. practice standard prescribe process implemented leaving subject forums handbooks manuals courses.,[],"['project management institute pmi practice standard guide use tool technique process identified guide project management body knowledge pmbok guide fourth edition pmi standard', 'practice standard targeted audience participate management project', 'includes project manager project personnel contract personnel supervisor project stakeholder', 'pmi practice standard describes process activity input output specific knowledge area', 'provides information significant process tool technique significant performed executed necessary clarification perform process', 'practice standard prescribe process implemented leaving subject forum handbook manual course']","['pmi standards practice standards', 'pmi practice standard', 'pmi standards practice', 'institute pmi practice standards', 'pmi practice standards', 'pmi practice standards guides', 'pmi practice standard describes', 'project stakeholders pmi practice', 'project management institute pmi', 'stakeholders pmi practice standard']",[],"['pmi standards practice standards', 'pmi practice standard', 'pmi standards practice', 'institute pmi practice standards', 'pmi practice standards', 'pmi practice standards guides', 'pmi practice standard describes', 'project stakeholders pmi practice', 'project management institute pmi', 'stakeholders pmi practice standard']"
 Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management,"The purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management is to a provide a standard for project management practitioners and other stakeholders that defines the aspects of Project Risk Management that are recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and b provide a standard that is globally applicable and consistently applied. This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes. The Practice Standard for Project Risk Management covers risk management as it is applied to single projects only. Like the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs or portfolios of projects. Chapter 11 of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, is the basis for the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. Figure 1-1 compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition and textbooks, handbooks, and courses. This practice standard is organized in three main sections 1. Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to Project Risk Management processes as defined in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. 2. Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. The six processes are as follows Plan Risk Management, Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk Responses, and Monitor and Control Risks. Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics a purpose and objectives of the process b critical success factors for the process c tools and techniques for the process and d documenting the results of the process. 3. A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, and successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for several reasons 1. Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and techniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. 2. Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. 3. The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, re ecting the many business and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures between commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organizations processes. Practitioners can establish processes specific to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.",purpose practice standard project risk management provide standard project management practitioners stakeholders defines aspects project risk management recognized good practice

 Project Risk Management Definition,"The definition of Project Risk Management, as defined in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, is the basis for this practice standard Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting risk management planning, identification, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project. The PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition also states The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the probability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the project. In the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a projects objectives. Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, and quality. Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide action-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as their impact on objectives.",definition project risk management defined pmbok guide fourth edition basis practice standard project risk management includes processes concerned conducting risk management planning identification analysis responses monitoring control project. pmbok guide fourth edition also states objectives project risk management increase probability impact positive events decrease probability impact negative events project. pmbok guide fourth edition project risk uncertain event condition occurs positive negative effect projects objectives. project objectives include scope schedule cost quality. project risk management aims identify prioritize risks advance occurrence provide action-oriented information project managers. orientation requires consideration events may may occur therefore described terms likelihood probability occurrence addition dimensions impact objectives.,[],"['definition project risk management defined pmbok guide fourth edition basis practice standard project risk management includes process concerned conducting risk management planning identification analysis response monitoring control project', 'pmbok guide fourth edition also state objective project risk management increase probability impact positive event decrease probability impact negative event project', 'pmbok guide fourth edition project risk uncertain event condition occurs positive negative effect project objective', 'project objective include scope schedule cost quality', 'project risk management aim identify prioritize risk advance occurrence provide action-oriented information project manager', 'orientation requires consideration event may may occur therefore described term likelihood probability occurrence addition dimension impact objective']","['standard project risk management', 'standard project risk', 'project risk management', 'project risk management defined', 'definition project risk management', 'objectives project risk management', 'definition project risk', 'project risk management includes', 'project risk management increase', 'project risk management aims']","['standard project risk management', 'project risk management', 'project risk management defined', 'definition project risk management', 'objectives project risk management', 'definition project risk', 'project risk management includes', 'project risk management increase', 'project risk management aims']",['standard project risk']
 Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management,"Project Risk Management is not an optional activity it is essential to successful project management. It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In this way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every process group. Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to final design and from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of project risks. Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and change management be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of confidence for meeting project objectives. There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. A risk management approach is applicable throughout a projects life cycle. The earlier in the project life cycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in place, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. During project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice.",project risk management optional activity essential successful project management. applied projects hence included project plans operational documents. way becomes integral part

 Good Risk Management Practice,"Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of the other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the multi-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets, make commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements. Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project Management code of ethics or conduct. Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing with others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk Management benefits from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identification, analysis, and response, in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable influences. Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of tools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the characteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted in the background with a exible deadline. Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under management during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions made in that process remain appropriate.",project risk management valuable component project management enhances value project management processes. processes project risk management conducted manner consistent existing organizational practices policies. addition like processes involved project management project risk management conducted way appropriate project. project risk management recognize business challenges well multi-cultural environment associated increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects customers suppliers workforces spread around globe. changes project management plan result project risk management process may require decisions appropriate level management reassign personnel establish modify budgets make commitments others outside project interact regulators comply rules accounting law. project risk management conducted compliance internal external requirements. project risk management always conducted ethical basis keeping project management code ethics conduct. honesty responsibility realism professionalism fair dealing others among characteristics successful project risk management. effective project risk management benefits robust communication consultation stakeholders. enables agreement among stakeholders project risk management general risk identification analysis response particular carried realistic objective way subject political unreasonable influences. project risk management conducted projects. degree level detail sophistication tools amount time resources applied project risk management proportion characteristics project management value add outcome. thus large project provides value important customer would theoretically require resources time attention project risk management would smaller short-term internal project conducted background exible deadline. project risk management processes scaled appropriate project management plan risk management process reviewed periodically determine decisions made process remain appropriate.,[],"['project risk management valuable component project management enhances value project management process', 'process project risk management conducted manner consistent existing organizational practice policy', 'addition like process involved project management project risk management conducted way appropriate project', 'project risk management recognize business challenge well multi-cultural environment associated increasingly global environment including many joint venture project customer supplier workforce spread around globe', 'change project management plan result project risk management process may require decision appropriate level management reassign personnel establish modify budget make commitment others outside project interact regulator comply rule accounting law', 'project risk management conducted compliance internal external requirement', 'project risk management always conducted ethical basis keeping project management code ethic conduct', 'honesty responsibility realism professionalism fair dealing others among characteristic successful project risk management', 'effective project risk management benefit robust communication consultation stakeholder', 'enables agreement among stakeholder project risk management general risk identification analysis response particular carried realistic objective way subject political unreasonable influence', 'project risk management conducted project', 'degree level detail sophistication tool amount time resource applied project risk management proportion characteristic project management value add outcome', 'thus large project provides value important customer would theoretically require resource time attention project risk management would smaller short-term internal project conducted background exible deadline', 'project risk management process scaled appropriate project management plan risk management process reviewed periodically determine decision made process remain appropriate']","['project risk management', 'project risk management processes', 'project risk management conducted', 'management project risk management', 'risk management conducted projects', 'project project risk management', 'project risk management process', 'project risk management recognize', 'project risk management effective', 'project risk management general']",[],"['project risk management', 'project risk management processes', 'project risk management conducted', 'management project risk management', 'risk management conducted projects', 'project project risk management', 'project risk management process', 'project risk management recognize', 'project risk management effective', 'project risk management general']"
 Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management,"Specific criteria for success of each Project Risk Management process are listed in the chapters dealing with those processes. The general criteria for success include Recognize the Value of Risk Management Project Risk Management should be recognized as a valuable discipline that provides a positive potential return on investment for organizational management, project stakeholders both internal and external, project management, and team members. Individual CommitmentResponsibility Project participants and stakeholders should all accept responsibility for undertaking risk-related activities as required. Risk management is everybodys responsibility. Open and Honest Communication Everyone should be involved in the Project Risk Management process. Any actions or attitudes that hinder communication about project risk reduce the effectiveness of Project Risk Management in terms of proactive approaches and effective decision-making. Organizational Commitment Organizational commitment can only be established if risk management is aligned with the organizations goals and values. Project Risk Management may require a higher level of managerial support than other project management disciplines because handling some of the risks will require approval of or responses from others at levels above the project manager. Risk Effort Scaled to Project Project Risk Management activities should be consistent with the value of the project to the organization and with its level of project risk, its scale, and other organizational constraints. In particular, the cost of Project Risk Management should be appropriate to its potential value to the project and the organization. Integration with Project Management Project Risk Management does not exist in a vacuum, isolated from other project management processes. Successful Project Risk Management requires the correct execution of the other project management processes.

 Definition of Project Risk,"The word risk is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process descriptions. The definition of project risk given in the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition is as follows Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative effect on a projects objectives. This definition includes two key dimensions of risk uncertainty and effect on a projects objectives. When assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty dimension may be described using the term probability and the effect may be called impact though other descriptors are possible, such as likelihood and consequence. The definition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and more general conditions which are less specific but also may give risk to uncertainty. The definition of project risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a projects objectives, as well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a unified Project Risk Management process. This allows for the gain of synergies and efficiencies such as addressing both in the same analyses and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other. 1 Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project objectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described see Section 5.3. When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or problems opportunities which occur may be called benefits. Both issuesproblems and benefits entail project management actions that are outside the scope of the Project Risk Management process.",word risk used many ways everyday language various specialist disciplines. use pmbok guide fourth edition consistent risk management standards process descriptions. definition project risk given pmbok guide fourth edition follows project risk uncertain event condition occurs positive negative effect projects objectives. definition includes two key dimensions risk uncertainty effect projects objectives. assessing importance project risk two dimensions must considered. uncertainty dimension may described using term probability effect may called impact though descriptors possible likelihood consequence. definition risk includes distinct events uncertain clearly described general conditions less specific also may give risk uncertainty. definition project risk also encompasses uncertain events could negative effect projects objectives well could positive effect. two types risk called respectively threats opportunities. important address threats opportunities within unified project risk management process. allows gain synergies efficiencies addressing analyses coordinating responses overlap reinforce other. 1 risks uncertain future events conditions may may occur would matter occur. important distinguish risks risk-related features cause effect. causes events circumstances currently exist certain exist future might give rise risks. effects conditional future events conditions would directly affect one project objectives associated risk occurs. cause-risk-effect chain used structured risk statement risk description ensure three elements properly described see section 5.3. risk event occurs ceases become uncertain. threats occur may called issues problems opportunities occur may called benefits. issuesproblems benefits entail project management actions outside scope project risk management process.,[],"['word risk used many way everyday language various specialist discipline', 'use pmbok guide fourth edition consistent risk management standard process description', 'definition project risk given pmbok guide fourth edition follows project risk uncertain event condition occurs positive negative effect project objective', 'definition includes two key dimension risk uncertainty effect project objective', 'assessing importance project risk two dimension must considered', 'uncertainty dimension may described using term probability effect may called impact though descriptor possible likelihood consequence', 'definition risk includes distinct event uncertain clearly described general condition le specific also may give risk uncertainty', 'definition project risk also encompasses uncertain event could negative effect project objective well could positive effect', 'two type risk called respectively threat opportunity', 'important address threat opportunity within unified project risk management process', 'allows gain synergy efficiency addressing analysis coordinating response overlap reinforce other', '1 risk uncertain future event condition may may occur would matter occur', 'important distinguish risk risk-related feature cause effect', 'cause event circumstance currently exist certain exist future might give rise risk', 'effect conditional future event condition would directly affect one project objective associated risk occurs', 'cause-risk-effect chain used structured risk statement risk description ensure three element properly described see section 5.3. risk event occurs cease become uncertain', 'threat occur may called issue problem opportunity occur may called benefit', 'issuesproblems benefit entail project management action outside scope project risk management process']","['definition project risk encompasses', 'project risk management', 'risk called respectively threats', 'definition project risk given', 'risk description', 'project risk dimensions considered', 'project risk encompasses', 'descriptions definition project risk', 'definition project risk', 'project objectives associated risk']","['definition project risk encompasses', 'project risk management', 'definition project risk given', 'project risk dimensions considered', 'project risk encompasses', 'descriptions definition project risk', 'definition project risk', 'project objectives associated risk']","['risk called respectively threats', 'risk description']"
 Individual Risks and Overall Project Risk,"It is useful to consider project risk at two levels individual risks and overall project risk. Individual risks are specific events or conditions that might affect project objectives. An individual risk may positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives, elements, or tasks. Understanding individual risks can assist in determining how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project success. Day-to-day Project Risk Management focuses on these individual risks in order to enhance the prospects of a successful project outcome. Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall project risk is more than the sum of individual risks on a project, since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual elements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome. It is an important component of strategic decision-making, program and portfolio management, and project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set. At these higher levels, it is necessary to set realistic targets for the cost and duration of a project, establish the contingency reserve levels required to protect the project stakeholders, set appropriate project priorities, and judge whether the risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances.",useful consider project risk two levels individual risks overall project risk. individual risks specific events conditions might affect project objectives. individual risk may positively negatively affect one project objectives elements tasks. understanding individual risks assist determining apply effort resources enhance chances project success. day-to-day project risk management focuses individual risks order enhance prospects successful project outcome. overall project risk represents effect uncertainty project whole. overall project risk sum individual risks project since applies whole project rather individual elements tasks. represents exposure stakeholders implications variations project outcome. important component strategic decision-making program portfolio management project governance investments sanctioned cancelled priorities set. higher levels necessary set realistic targets cost duration project establish contingency reserve levels required protect project stakeholders set appropriate project priorities judge whether risk overall success increasing decreasing implementation advances.,[],"['useful consider project risk two level individual risk overall project risk', 'individual risk specific event condition might affect project objective', 'individual risk may positively negatively affect one project objective element task', 'understanding individual risk assist determining apply effort resource enhance chance project success', 'day-to-day project risk management focus individual risk order enhance prospect successful project outcome', 'overall project risk represents effect uncertainty project whole', 'overall project risk sum individual risk project since applies whole project rather individual element task', 'represents exposure stakeholder implication variation project outcome', 'important component strategic decision-making program portfolio management project governance investment sanctioned cancelled priority set', 'higher level necessary set realistic target cost duration project establish contingency reserve level required protect project stakeholder set appropriate project priority judge whether risk overall success increasing decreasing implementation advance']","['risks overall project risk', 'project overall project risk', 'risks overall project', 'project risk management', 'consider project risk', 'consider project risk levels', 'overall project risk represents', 'project risk levels', 'project risk', 'project risk individual risks']","['risks overall project risk', 'project overall project risk', 'risks overall project', 'project risk management', 'consider project risk', 'consider project risk levels', 'overall project risk represents', 'project risk levels', 'project risk', 'project risk individual risks']",[]
 Stakeholder Risk Attitudes,"The risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall project risk matters. A wide range of factors influence risk attitude. These include the scale of the project within the range of stakeholders overall activities, the strength of public commitments made about the performance of the project, and the stakeholders sensitivity to issues such as environmental impacts, industrial relations, and other factors. Stakeholder risk attitudes usually result in a desire for increased certainty in project outcomes, and may express a preference for one project objective over another. How risk is regarded is usually also strongly influenced by an organizations culture. Different organizations are more or less open, and this often impacts the way risk management can be applied. 1 Understanding stakeholders attitudes toward risk is an important component of risk management planning that precedes risk identification and analysis, in order to optimize both project success and stakeholder satisfaction with the projects results. These attitudes should be identified and managed proactively and deliberately throughout the Project Risk Management process. They may differ from one project to another for the same stakeholders and will usually differ from one group of stakeholders to another. In fact a single stakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes at various stages in the same project. It is also important to understand the particular implications of stakeholder risk attitudes on projects where the team is international, cross-industry, or multi-organizational.",risk attitudes project stakeholders determine extent individual risk overall project risk matters. wide range factors influence risk attitude. include scale project within range stakeholders overall activities strength public commitments made performance project stakeholders sensitivity issues environmental impacts industrial relations factors. stakeholder risk attitudes usually result desire increased certainty project outcomes may express preference one project objective another. risk regarded usually also strongly influenced organizations culture. different organizations less open often impacts way risk management applied. 1 understanding stakeholders attitudes toward risk important component risk management planning precedes risk identification analysis order optimize project success stakeholder satisfaction projects results. attitudes identified managed proactively deliberately throughout project risk management process. may differ one project another stakeholders usually differ one group stakeholders another. fact single stakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes various stages project. also important understand particular implications stakeholder risk attitudes projects team international cross-industry multi-organizational.,[],"['risk attitude project stakeholder determine extent individual risk overall project risk matter', 'wide range factor influence risk attitude', 'include scale project within range stakeholder overall activity strength public commitment made performance project stakeholder sensitivity issue environmental impact industrial relation factor', 'stakeholder risk attitude usually result desire increased certainty project outcome may express preference one project objective another', 'risk regarded usually also strongly influenced organization culture', 'different organization le open often impact way risk management applied', '1 understanding stakeholder attitude toward risk important component risk management planning precedes risk identification analysis order optimize project success stakeholder satisfaction project result', 'attitude identified managed proactively deliberately throughout project risk management process', 'may differ one project another stakeholder usually differ one group stakeholder another', 'fact single stakeholder may adopt different risk attitude various stage project', 'also important understand particular implication stakeholder risk attitude project team international cross-industry multi-organizational']","['stakeholder risk attitudes projects', 'risk attitudes project stakeholders', 'understanding stakeholders attitudes risk', 'stakeholders attitudes risk important', 'implications stakeholder risk attitudes', 'stakeholder risk attitudes', 'risk attitudes projects team', 'stakeholder risk attitudes usually', 'stakeholders attitudes risk', 'factors stakeholder risk attitudes']","['stakeholder risk attitudes projects', 'risk attitudes project stakeholders', 'understanding stakeholders attitudes risk', 'stakeholders attitudes risk important', 'implications stakeholder risk attitudes', 'stakeholder risk attitudes', 'stakeholder risk attitudes usually', 'stakeholders attitudes risk', 'factors stakeholder risk attitudes']",['risk attitudes projects team']
 Iterative Process,"It is the nature of projects that circumstances change as they are being planned and executed. The amount of information available about risks will usually increase as time goes on. Some risks will occur while others will not, new risks will arise or be discovered, and the characteristics of those already identified may change. As a result, the Project Risk Management processes should be repeated and the corresponding plans progressively elaborated throughout the lifetime of the project. To ensure that Project Risk Management remains effective, the identification and analysis of risks should be revisited periodically, the progress on risk response actions should be monitored, and the action plans adjusted accordingly. If external circumstances change significantly, it may also be necessary to revisit the risk management planning process. The development of an initial risk management plan and risk assessment is the start of the process, not the end.

 Communication,Project Risk Management cannot take place in isolation. Success relies heavily on communication throughout the process. Risk identification and analysis depend on comprehensive input from stakeholders in a project to ensure that nothing significant is overlooked and that risks are realistically assessed. The credibility of the process and the commitment of those who should act to manage risks can be assured only if the way the process operates and the conclusions it produces are understood and seen as credible by all concerned. This demands effective and honest communication from the Project Risk Management process to the rest of the project team and other project stakeholders. Communication of the results of the Project Risk Management process should be targeted to meet the specific needs of each stakeholder and should be re ected within the overall project communications strategy with each stakeholders responsibility and role in risk management identified and agreed-upon. 1,project risk management cannot take place isolation. success relies heavily communication throughout process. risk identification analysis depend comprehensive input stakeholders project ensure nothing significant overlooked risks realistically assessed. credibility process commitment act manage risks assured way process operates conclusions produces understood seen credible concerned. demands effective honest communication project risk management process rest project team project stakeholders. communication results project risk management process targeted meet specific needs stakeholder ected within overall project communications strategy stakeholders responsibility role risk management identified agreed-upon. 1,[],"['project risk management cannot take place isolation', 'success relies heavily communication throughout process', 'risk identification analysis depend comprehensive input stakeholder project ensure nothing significant overlooked risk realistically assessed', 'credibility process commitment act manage risk assured way process operates conclusion produce understood seen credible concerned', 'demand effective honest communication project risk management process rest project team project stakeholder', 'communication result project risk management process targeted meet specific need stakeholder ected within overall project communication strategy stakeholder responsibility role risk management identified agreed-upon']","['communication results project risk', 'project risk management', 'risk management identified', 'communication project risk', 'project risk management place', 'communication project risk management', 'project risk management process', 'risk management process', 'results project risk management', 'project risk']",[],"['communication results project risk', 'project risk management', 'risk management identified', 'communication project risk', 'project risk management place', 'communication project risk management', 'project risk management process', 'risk management process', 'results project risk management', 'project risk']"
 Responsibility for Project Risk Management,"It may be considered simplistic to say risk management is everyones responsibility as previously stated. However it is important that management of project risk is not left to a few risk specialists. Project Risk Management should be included as an integral part of all other project processes. Since project risks can affect project objectives, anyone with an interest in achieving those objectives should play a role in Project Risk Management. The specific roles depend on the project team members and other stakeholders place within the project and their relation to project objectives. Roles and responsibilities for Project Risk Management should be clearly defined and communicated, and individuals should be held responsible and accountable for results. This includes allocating responsibility for specific activities within the risk process, as well as for resulting actions required to implement agreed-upon responses. Responsibility should also be allocated for ensuring that risk-related lessons are captured for future use.",may considered simplistic say risk management everyones responsibility previously stated. however important management project risk left risk specialists. project risk management included integral part project processes. since project risks affect project objectives anyone interest achieving objectives play role project risk management. specific roles depend project team members stakeholders place within project relation project objectives. roles responsibilities project risk management clearly defined communicated individuals held responsible accountable results. includes allocating responsibility specific activities within risk process well resulting actions required implement agreed-upon responses. responsibility also allocated ensuring risk-related lessons captured future use.,[],"['may considered simplistic say risk management everyones responsibility previously stated', 'however important management project risk left risk specialist', 'project risk management included integral part project process', 'since project risk affect project objective anyone interest achieving objective play role project risk management', 'specific role depend project team member stakeholder place within project relation project objective', 'role responsibility project risk management clearly defined communicated individual held responsible accountable result', 'includes allocating responsibility specific activity within risk process well resulting action required implement agreed-upon response', 'responsibility also allocated ensuring risk-related lesson captured future use']","['role project risk management', 'responsibilities project risk', 'project risk management', 'responsibilities project risk management', 'project risk management clearly', 'specialists project risk management', 'risk management everyones responsibility', 'project risk management specific', 'roles responsibilities project risk', 'project risk management included']","['role project risk management', 'responsibilities project risk', 'project risk management', 'responsibilities project risk management', 'project risk management clearly', 'project risk management specific', 'project risk management included']","['specialists project risk management', 'risk management everyones responsibility', 'roles responsibilities project risk']"

 INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES,"All projects are uncertain. Uncertainty is inevitable since projects are unique and temporary undertakings based on assumptions and constraints, delivering project results to multiple stakeholders with different requirements. Project management can be seen as an attempt to control this uncertain environment, through the use of structured and disciplined techniques such as estimating, planning, cost control, task allocation, earned value analysis, monitoring and review meetings, etc. Each of these elements of project management has a role in defining or controlling the uncertainty which is inherent in all projects. Project Risk Management provides an approach by which uncertainty can be understood, assessed, and managed within projects. As such it forms an integral part of project management, and effective Project Risk Management is a critical success factor for project success. For project management to be fully effective, however, it is important that Project Risk Management is not viewed as an optional process or performed as an additional overhead task. Since many elements of project management address inherent uncertainty, the interface between structured Project Risk Management and the other processes of project management needs to be clear. The outputs of Project Risk Management should be taken into account within many of the project management processes. They can, for example, impact Estimating resource requirements, cost, or duration Assessing the impact of proposed scope changes Planning or re-planning the forward strategy of the project Allocating resources to tasks and Reporting progress to stakeholders. None of these actions can be performed properly without a clear view of the risk involved, as determined during the Project Risk Management process. In other words, project management process effectiveness is increased by using the information and results from Project Risk Management. In addition, effective Project Risk Management requires input from other project management processes. Outputs such as the work breakdown structure WBS, estimates, the project schedule, assumptions list, etc. are all important prerequisites for effective Project Risk Management. 1",projects uncertain. uncertainty inevitable since projects unique temporary undertakings based assumptions constraints delivering project results multiple stakeholders different requirements. project management seen attempt control uncertain environment use structured disciplined techniques estimating planning cost control task allocation earned value analysis monitoring review meetings etc. elements project management role defining controlling uncertainty inherent projects. project risk management provides approach uncertainty understood assessed managed within projects. forms integral part project management effective project risk management critical success factor project success. project management fully effective however important project risk management viewed optional process performed additional overhead task. since many elements project management address inherent uncertainty interface structured project risk management processes project management needs clear. outputs project risk management taken account within many project management processes. example impact estimating resource requirements cost duration assessing impact proposed scope changes planning re-planning forward strategy project allocating resources tasks reporting progress stakeholders. none actions performed properly without clear view risk involved determined project risk management process. words project management process effectiveness increased using information results project risk management. addition effective project risk management requires input project management processes. outputs work breakdown structure wbs estimates project schedule assumptions list etc. important prerequisites effective project risk management. 1,[],"['project uncertain', 'uncertainty inevitable since project unique temporary undertaking based assumption constraint delivering project result multiple stakeholder different requirement', 'project management seen attempt control uncertain environment use structured disciplined technique estimating planning cost control task allocation earned value analysis monitoring review meeting etc', 'element project management role defining controlling uncertainty inherent project', 'project risk management provides approach uncertainty understood assessed managed within project', 'form integral part project management effective project risk management critical success factor project success', 'project management fully effective however important project risk management viewed optional process performed additional overhead task', 'since many element project management address inherent uncertainty interface structured project risk management process project management need clear', 'output project risk management taken account within many project management process', 'example impact estimating resource requirement cost duration assessing impact proposed scope change planning re-planning forward strategy project allocating resource task reporting progress stakeholder', 'none action performed properly without clear view risk involved determined project risk management process', 'word project management process effectiveness increased using information result project risk management', 'addition effective project risk management requires input project management process', 'output work breakdown structure wb estimate project schedule assumption list etc', 'important prerequisite effective project risk management']","['project risk management', 'project risk management critical', 'project risk management taken', 'management effective project risk', 'project risk management requires', 'important project risk management', 'project risk management process', 'determined project risk management', 'projects project risk management', 'project risk management viewed']","['project risk management', 'project risk management critical', 'project risk management taken', 'management effective project risk', 'project risk management requires', 'important project risk management', 'project risk management process', 'determined project risk management', 'projects project risk management', 'project risk management viewed']",[]
 Project Risk Management Processes,"The defined steps of Project Risk Management describe a structured approach for understanding and managing risk on a project. This chapter outlines the steps required for effective Project Risk Management. Each step is described in more detail in subsequent chapters. As previously defined, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a projects objectives. From this definition, it is clear that risks only exist in relation to objectives. It is therefore essential at the start of the Project Risk Management process to clearly define the objectives. It is also clear that different projects are exposed to different levels of risk, so each step in the Project Risk Management process should be scalable to meet the varying degrees of risk. Scalable elements of the process include Available resources, Methodology and processes used, Tools and techniques used, Supporting infrastructure, Review and update frequency, and Reporting requirements. As a precondition for a successful Project Risk Management implementation, it is important to have a clear understanding of the risk thresholds that define the key stakeholders views on acceptable levels of risk, as well as a framework against which identified risks can be assessed. As a result, the Project Risk Management process always starts with an initiation step. This is required in order to ensure a common understanding and agreement of the team and other stakeholders on the approach and parameters that will be applied in managing risk in this project, as well as the scope and objectives of the Project Risk Management process itself. Project Risk Management activities, resources, and attention should be appropriate to the project since different projects warrant different levels of risk management application. The main actions to provide the required tailoring are as follows Define those objectives against which risks will be identified, Define how the elements of the Project Risk Management process will be scaled for this project, and Define risk thresholds, tolerances, and the assessment framework. The outputs from this initial step should be documented, communicated, and then reviewed by the stakeholders to ensure a common understanding of the scope and objectives for the Project Risk Management process. The document should be formally approved at a senior level. 1 Once the Project Risk Management scope and objectives are agreed upon, it is possible to start identifying risks, being careful to distinguish genuine risks from non-risks such as causes, effects, problems, issues etc.. A variety of risk identification techniques is available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. One or more techniques should be selected as appropriate for meeting the needs of the specific project. The aim is to expose and document all knowable risks, recognizing that some risks will be inherently unknowable and others will emerge later in the project. The emergent nature of risk requires the Project Risk Management process to be iterative, repeating the Identify Risks process in order to find risks which were not evident earlier in the project. Input should be sought from a wide range of project stakeholders when identifying risks, since each will have a different perspective on the risks facing the project. Historical records and project documents should also be reviewed to identify risks for this project. All identified risks are recorded. Ideally, a risk owner is designated for each identified risk. It is the responsibility of the risk owner to manage the corresponding risk through all of the subsequent Project Risk Management processes. Following risk identification, it is necessary to evaluate the importance of each risk, in order to prioritize individual risks for further attention, evaluate the level of overall project risk, and determine appropriate responses. Risk evaluation can be performed using qualitative techniques to address individual risks, using quantitative techniques to consider the overall effect of risk on the project outcome, or using both in combination. These two approaches require different types of data, but where both qualitative and quantitative techniques are used, an integrated approach should be adopted. Qualitative techniques are used to gain a better understanding of individual risks, considering a range of characteristics such as probability of occurrence, degree of impact on project objectives, manageability, timing of possible impacts, relationships with other risks, common causes or effects, etc. Understanding and prioritizing risks is an essential prerequisite to managing them, so qualitative techniques are used on most projects. The outputs from qualitative assessments should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and form a basis for determining appropriate responses. Quantitative techniques provide insights into the combined effect of identified risks on the project outcome. These techniques take into account probabilistic or project-wide effects, such as correlation between risks, interdependency, and feedback loops, thereby indicating the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The result is an indication of the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The results of quantitative analysis should be used to focus the development of appropriate responses, particularly the calculation of required contingency reserve levels, and must be documented and communicated to inform subsequent actions. Quantitative techniques may not be required for all projects to ensure effective management of risk. 1 Once individual risks have been prioritized and the degree of overall project risk exposure is understood, appropriate risk responses should be developed using an iterative process which continues until an optimal set of responses has been developed. A range of possible response strategies exists for both threats and opportunities. The risk owner should select a suitable strategy for each individual risk, based on its characteristics and assessed priority, ensuring that the strategy is achievable, affordable, cost effective, and appropriate. The use of a single strategy that addresses several related risks should be considered whenever possible. The risk owner is responsible for defining actions to implement the chosen strategy. These actions may be delegated to action owners as appropriate. The risk owner should monitor actions to determine their effectiveness, and also to identify any secondary risks which may arise because of the implementation of risk responses. In addition to individual risk responses, actions may be taken to respond to overall project risk. All response strategies and actions should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and incorporated into the project plan. It is essential that agreed-upon actions are implemented otherwise the risk exposure of the project remains unchanged. It is also vital that the Project Risk Management process be repeated at regular intervals throughout the life of the project. This will enable the project team to reevaluate the status of previously identified risks, to identify emergent and secondary risks, and to determine the effectiveness of the Project Risk Management process. The steps outlined previously form the Project Risk Management process. These are detailed in subsequent chapters, as follows Plan Risk Management Chapter 4 Defines the scope and objectives of the Project Risk Management process, and ensures that the risk process is fully integrated into wider project management. Identify Risks Chapter 5 Identifies as many knowable risks as practicable. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Chapter 6 Evaluates key characteristics of individual risks enabling them to be prioritized for further action. Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis Chapter 7 Evaluates the combined effect of risks on the overall project outcome. Plan Risk Responses Chapter 8 Determines appropriate response strategies and actions for each individual risk and for overall project risk, and integrates them into a consolidated project management plan. Monitor and Control Risks Chapter 9 Implements agreed-upon actions, reviews changes in project risk exposure, identifies additional risk management actions as required, and assesses the effectiveness of the Project Risk Management process.

 PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT,"The objectives of the Plan Risk Management process are to develop the overall risk management strategy for the project, to decide how the risk management processes will be executed, and to integrate Project Risk Management with all other project management activities. Effective risk management requires creation of a risk management plan. This plan describes how the risk management processes should be carried out and how they fit in with the other project management processes. On a broader level, it describes the relationships among Project Risk Management, general project management, and the management processes in the rest of the organization. To provide the greatest benefit, initial risk management planning should be carried out early in the overall planning of the project, and the corresponding risk management activities integrated into the overall project management plan. The risk management plan may subsequently need to be adapted as the needs of the project and its stakeholders become clearer or change. Although the Project Risk Management processes form an integral part of the overall project management plan, a budget in terms of resources, cost, and time for the specific risk management activities should be established in order to better track, control, and, as necessary, defend the corresponding expenditures throughout the project. The cost of treating the risks themselves should be included appropriately in the project budget, while the risk management plan should describe how this part of the project budget is evaluated, allocated, and managed. The risk management plan will define the monitoring methods to ensure that the corresponding expenditures are tracked appropriately, as well as the conditions under which the approved budget for risk management can be modified. In the same way that project management is a process of progressive elaboration, risk management activities need to be repeated throughout the project. The risk management plan should define both the normal frequency for repeating the processes as well as specific or exceptional conditions under which the corresponding actions should be initiated. The corresponding risk management activities should be integrated into the project management plan. There are two categories of success criteria for risk management those for success of the project in general, and those for success of Project Risk Management. 204 Project-Related Criteria. To assess the success of Project Risk Management, the stakeholders must agree on an acceptable level of results for the project-related criteria such as cost, time, and scope. In order to ensure consistency and agreement among stakeholders, the risk management plan should present these objectives with reference to the project definition documents. To provide guidance in risk management, particularly in prioritizing risk responses, stakeholders should also prioritize each project objective. Process-Related Criteria. The measures for success in Project Risk Management depend on a number of factors, such as the inherent level of uncertainty of the project. For example, the Project Risk Management process for a research project needs to address more unforeseen changes than for a project with a more predictable environment. A research Project Risk Management process may be considered a success even if it results in more variance from the baseline than would be allowable for a successful process in a more predictable project. The level of risk that is considered acceptable in a project depends on the risk attitudes of the relevant stakeholders. The risk attitudes of both the organization and the stakeholders may be influenced by a number of factors, all of which need to be identified. These include their inherent tolerance for uncertainty, and the relative importance to them of achieving or missing specific project objectives. The output of this analysis should then be taken into account for setting thresholds and providing weighting factors when applying the Project Risk Management processes in the specific project. Guidelines and rules for escalating risk-related information to management and other stakeholders should re ect the risk attitudes and expectations of the corresponding stakeholders. The project manager should maintain effective communication with the stakeholders as the project evolves, in order to become aware of any changes in the stakeholders attitudes and adapt the risk management approach to take any new facts into account. It is important that the participants share a common understanding of all terms used to describe the risks, and that the critical values and thresholds that will serve as parameters for the tools should be defined in a manner consistent with the scope of the project and the attitudes of the stakeholders. If qualitative analysis uses such terms as high impact or medium probability, these should be defined objectively in the risk management plan. Similarly, the risk management plan should specify any key numerical values required in quantitative analysis or for decision-making in risk response planning or risk monitoring and control. Risk management planning should establish the type and level of risk detail to be addressed and provide a template of the risk register that will be used for recording risk-related information. The risk management plan should also indicate the intensity of effort and the frequency with which the various Project Risk Management processes should be applied this depends on the characteristics of the project as well as on the specified risk management objectives. In order for the Project Risk Management processes to be carried out correctly and effectively, the project team and other stakeholders need to know where and when they will be expected to participate, their criteria for determining success, their level of authority, and what action to take relative to actions or decisions beyond this level. The risk management plan specifies the projects risk management roles and responsibilities and defines the corresponding expectations for both senior management and project personnel. 2 Risk-related communication occurs at two levels a within the project team, and b between the project team and the other project stakeholders. The principles for each of these categories of communication are defined in the risk management plan. For the team, the plan describes the frequency and scope of the various risk management meetings and reports required to carry out the corresponding Project Risk Management processes as well as the structure and content of such meetings and reports. For the other stakeholders, the plan sets their expectations as to the structure, content, and frequency of routine documents to be received as well as the way in which information will be shared for escalation or exceptional events. Details of the information required by the project team from stakeholders should also be clearly defined.",objectives plan risk management process develop overall risk management strategy project

 Identify and Address Barriers to Successful Project Risk Management,"The time and effort required to carry out the Plan Risk Management process will not be supported unless the stakeholders, and especially management in the organization responsible for the project, recognize and accept the benefits of managing risk, and the added value of addressing this as a skill in its own right rather than as a passive or reactive component of general project management. A clear definition of the project objectives and a high-level view of the project environment and solution approach are required to provide a valid basis for risk management. The project manager should therefore ensure that valid definition and planning information is available for the plan risk management activity. An organization inexperienced in risk management planning may need to develop its own approach and may expend an inappropriate amount of time and effort on this. Alternatively it may use a proprietary or pre-existing approach which requires tailoring. The availability of some or all of the following organizational process assets contributes to the chances of success of the Plan Risk Management activities standard templates, predefined risk categories, and an established project management methodology incorporating risk management procedures that specify what risk information is required for decision making, when it is required, and a definition of concepts and terms, roles, responsibilities, and authority levels. Access to relevant lessons learned at this stage will allow this experience to be taken into account from the start of the project. The risk management plan will not deliver its value unless Project Risk Management is carried out as an integral part of the project.

 IDENTIFY RISKS,"A risk cannot be managed unless it is first identified. Consequently, after risk management planning has been completed, the first process in the iterative Project Risk Management process aims to identify all the knowable risks to project objectives. It is, however, impossible to identify all the risks at the outset of a project. Over time, the level of project risk exposure changes as a result of the decisions and actions taken previously in the project internal change and of externally imposed change. The purpose of risk identification is to identify risks to the maximum extent that is practicable. The fact that some risks are unknowable or emergent requires the Identify Risk process to be iterative, repeating the Identify Risks process to find new risks which have become knowable since the previous iteration of the process. When a risk is first identified, potential responses may also be identified at the same time. These should be recorded during the Identify Risks process and considered for immediate action if such action is appropriate. Where such responses are not implemented immediately, these should be considered during the Plan Risk Responses process.",risk cannot managed unless first identified. consequently risk management planning completed first process iterative project risk management process aims identify knowable risks project objectives. however impossible identify risks outset project. time level project risk exposure changes result decisions actions taken previously project internal change externally imposed change. purpose risk identification identify risks maximum extent practicable. fact risks unknowable emergent requires identify risk process iterative repeating identify risks process find new risks become knowable since previous iteration process. risk first identified potential responses may also identified time. recorded identify risks process considered immediate action action appropriate. responses implemented immediately considered plan risk responses process.,[],"['risk cannot managed unless first identified', 'consequently risk management planning completed first process iterative project risk management process aim identify knowable risk project objective', 'however impossible identify risk outset project', 'time level project risk exposure change result decision action taken previously project internal change externally imposed change', 'purpose risk identification identify risk maximum extent practicable', 'fact risk unknowable emergent requires identify risk process iterative repeating identify risk process find new risk become knowable since previous iteration process', 'risk first identified potential response may also identified time', 'recorded identify risk process considered immediate action action appropriate', 'response implemented immediately considered plan risk response process']","['iterative project risk management', 'project risk management', 'identify risks outset project', 'project risk exposure', 'knowable risks project objectives', 'identify risks process considered', 'risks process considered', 'risks project objectives', 'project risk management process', 'risk management process']",['identify risks process considered'],"['iterative project risk management', 'project risk management', 'identify risks outset project', 'project risk exposure', 'knowable risks project objectives', 'risks process considered', 'risks project objectives', 'project risk management process', 'risk management process']"

 Early Identification,"Risk identification should be performed as early as possible in the project lifecycle, recognizing the paradox that uncertainty is high in the initial stages of a project so there is often less information on which to base the risk identification. Early risk identification enables key project decisions to take maximum account of risks inherent in the project, and may result in changes to the project strategy. It also maximizes the time available for development and implementation of risk responses, which enhances efficiency since responses taken early are often normally less costly than later ones. 2",risk identification performed early possible project lifecycle recognizing paradox uncertainty high initial stages project often less information base risk identification. early risk identification enables key project decisions take maximum account risks inherent project may result changes project strategy. also maximizes time available development implementation risk responses enhances efficiency since responses taken early often normally less costly later ones. 2,[],"['risk identification performed early possible project lifecycle recognizing paradox uncertainty high initial stage project often le information base risk identification', 'early risk identification enables key project decision take maximum account risk inherent project may result change project strategy', 'also maximizes time available development implementation risk response enhances efficiency since response taken early often normally le costly later one']","['risk identification', 'risks inherent project result', 'risk identification early', 'risk identification enables', 'early risk identification enables', 'early possible project lifecycle', 'risk identification performed early', 'risk identification early risk', 'risk identification performed', 'risks inherent project']",[],"['risk identification', 'risks inherent project result', 'risk identification early', 'risk identification enables', 'early risk identification enables', 'early possible project lifecycle', 'risk identification performed early', 'risk identification early risk', 'risk identification performed', 'risks inherent project']"
 Iterative Identification,"Since not all risks can be identified at any given point in the project, it is essential that risk identification is repeated throughout the project life cycle.

 Objectivity,"All human activities are susceptible to bias, especially when dealing with uncertainty. Both motivational biases, where someone is trying to bias the result in one direction or another, or cognitive biases, where biases occur as people are using their best judgment and applying heuristics, may occur.

 Current Assessments,"Current assessments rely on detailed consideration of the current project, analyzing its characteristics against given frameworks and models in order to expose areas of uncertainty. Unlike historical review approaches, current assessment techniques do not rely on outside reference points, but are based purely on examination of the project.",current assessments rely detailed consideration current project analyzing characteristics given frameworks models order expose areas uncertainty. unlike historical review approaches current assessment techniques rely outside reference points based purely examination project.,[],"['current assessment rely detailed consideration current project analyzing characteristic given framework model order expose area uncertainty', 'unlike historical review approach current assessment technique rely outside reference point based purely examination project']","['current assessments rely', 'consideration current project analyzing', 'assessments rely detailed consideration', 'approaches current assessment techniques', 'current assessments rely detailed', 'current assessments', 'current assessment techniques rely', 'assessment techniques rely', 'approaches current assessment', 'review approaches current assessment']","['current assessments rely', 'approaches current assessment techniques', 'current assessments rely detailed', 'current assessments', 'current assessment techniques rely', 'approaches current assessment', 'review approaches current assessment']","['consideration current project analyzing', 'assessments rely detailed consideration', 'assessment techniques rely']"
 Creativity Techniques,"A wide range of creativity techniques can be used for risk identification, which encourages project stakeholders to use their imagination to find risks which might affect the project. The outcomes or effectiveness of these techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively. These techniques can be used either singly or in groups, and employ varying degrees of structure. These techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively, and their success is enhanced by use of a skilled facilitator. Each category of risk identification technique has strengths and weaknesses, and no single technique can be expected to reveal all knowable risks. Consequently, the Identify Risks process for a particular project should use a combination of techniques, perhaps selecting one from each category. For example, a project may choose to use a risk identification checklist historical review, together with assumptions analysis current assessment and brainstorming creativity. Use of a risk breakdown structure which organizes the categories of potential risks on the project, a prompt list, or a set of generic list categories may assist in ensuring that as many sources of risk as practicable have been addressed, while recognizing that no such tools are complete nor can they replace original thinking. 2 Whichever risk identification techniques are used, it is important that identified risks are unambiguously described in order to ensure that the project risk process is focused on the actual risks and not distracted or diluted by non-risks. Use of structured risk descriptions can ensure clarity. Risk meta-language offers a useful way of distinguishing a risk from its causes and effects, describing each risk using three-part statements in the form As a result of cause, risk may occur, which would lead to effect. The relationship between cause, risk, and effect is shown in Figure 5-2.",wide range creativity techniques used risk identification encourages project stakeholders use imagination find risks might affect project. outcomes effectiveness techniques depend ability participants think creatively. techniques used either singly groups employ varying degrees structure. techniques depend ability participants think creatively success enhanced use skilled facilitator. category risk identification technique strengths weaknesses single technique expected reveal knowable risks. consequently identify risks process particular project use combination techniques perhaps selecting one category. example project may choose use risk identification checklist historical review together assumptions analysis current assessment brainstorming creativity. use risk breakdown structure organizes categories potential risks project prompt list set generic list categories may assist ensuring many sources risk practicable addressed recognizing tools complete replace original thinking. 2 whichever risk identification techniques used important identified risks unambiguously described order ensure project risk process focused actual risks distracted diluted non-risks. use structured risk descriptions ensure clarity. risk meta-language offers useful way distinguishing risk causes effects describing risk using three-part statements form result cause risk may occur would lead effect. relationship cause risk effect shown figure 5-2.,['https://i.ibb.co/mcRP0Ys/page-41-png-roi-0-0-91.jpg'],"['wide range creativity technique used risk identification encourages project stakeholder use imagination find risk might affect project', 'outcome effectiveness technique depend ability participant think creatively', 'technique used either singly group employ varying degree structure', 'technique depend ability participant think creatively success enhanced use skilled facilitator', 'category risk identification technique strength weakness single technique expected reveal knowable risk', 'consequently identify risk process particular project use combination technique perhaps selecting one category', 'example project may choose use risk identification checklist historical review together assumption analysis current assessment brainstorming creativity', 'use risk breakdown structure organizes category potential risk project prompt list set generic list category may assist ensuring many source risk practicable addressed recognizing tool complete replace original thinking', '2 whichever risk identification technique used important identified risk unambiguously described order ensure project risk process focused actual risk distracted diluted non-risks', 'use structured risk description ensure clarity', 'risk meta-language offer useful way distinguishing risk cause effect describing risk using three-part statement form result cause risk may occur would lead effect', 'relationship cause risk effect shown figure 5-2.']","['creativity techniques used risk', 'creativity use risk breakdown', 'brainstorming creativity use risk', 'risks project prompt', 'risk identification encourages project', 'potential risks project prompt', 'creativity use risk', 'potential risks project', 'risks project', 'imagination risks affect project']",[],"['creativity techniques used risk', 'creativity use risk breakdown', 'brainstorming creativity use risk', 'risks project prompt', 'risk identification encourages project', 'potential risks project prompt', 'creativity use risk', 'potential risks project', 'risks project', 'imagination risks affect project']"
 Documenting the Results of the Identify Risks Process,"The results from the Identify Risks process should be recorded in order to capture all relevant information currently available for each identified risk. The main output from the Identify Risks process is the risk register. This includes a properly structured risk description and the nominated risk owner for each risk, and may also include information on the causes and effects of the risk, trigger conditions, and preliminary responses. 3",results identify risks process recorded order capture relevant information currently available identified risk. main output identify risks process risk register. includes properly structured risk description nominated risk owner risk may also include information causes effects risk trigger conditions preliminary responses. 3,[],"['result identify risk process recorded order capture relevant information currently available identified risk', 'main output identify risk process risk register', 'includes properly structured risk description nominated risk owner risk may also include information cause effect risk trigger condition preliminary response']","['identify risks process', 'identify risks process risk', 'risks process risk register', 'identify risks', 'risks process', 'risk description', 'risk include information', 'identify risks process recorded', 'risks process recorded', 'risks process risk']","['identify risks process', 'identify risks process recorded']","['identify risks process risk', 'risks process risk register', 'identify risks', 'risks process', 'risk description', 'risk include information', 'risks process recorded', 'risks process risk']"
 PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS,"The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process assesses and evaluates characteristics of individually identified project risks and prioritizes risks based on agreed-upon characteristics. Assessing individual risks using qualitative risk analysis evaluates the probability that each risk will occur and the effect of each individual risk on the project objectives. As such it does not directly address the overall risk to project objectives that results from the combined effect of all risks and their potential interactions with each other. This can however be achieved through use of quantitative risk analysis techniques see Chapter 7. One step in the analysis is to categorize risks according to their sources or causes. If several risks arise from a common source, sometimes called a root cause, risk responses may be more effective when they focus on addressing this root cause. Identifying common effects from groups of risks allows identification of the areas of greatest risk exposure e.g. to the project completion date, the budget, or a particular deliverables scope, facilitating risk response focus in these areas. The methods of qualitative risk analysis are applied to the list of risks created or updated by the Identify Risks process to provide project management with the characteristics of the risks that have the most influence positive or negative on achieving the projects objectives. Risks that are assessed as high priority to either threaten or to enhance the achievement of project objectives will be an important focus in the Plan Risk Responses process. They may be further analyzed, such as in the analysis of the overall project risk that is discussed in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process.",perform qualitative risk analysis process assesses evaluates characteristics individually identified project risks prioritizes risks based agreed-upon characteristics. assessing individual risks using qualitative risk analysis evaluates probability risk occur effect individual risk project objectives. directly address overall risk project objectives results combined effect risks potential interactions other. however achieved use quantitative risk analysis techniques see chapter 7. one step analysis categorize risks according sources causes. several risks arise common source sometimes called root cause risk responses may effective focus addressing root cause. identifying common effects groups risks allows identification areas greatest risk exposure example. project completion date budget particular deliverables scope facilitating risk response focus areas. methods qualitative risk analysis applied list risks created updated identify risks process provide project management characteristics risks influence positive negative achieving projects objectives. risks assessed high priority either threaten enhance achievement project objectives important focus plan risk responses process. may analyzed analysis overall project risk discussed perform quantitative risk analysis process.,[],"['perform qualitative risk analysis process ass evaluates characteristic individually identified project risk prioritizes risk based agreed-upon characteristic', 'assessing individual risk using qualitative risk analysis evaluates probability risk occur effect individual risk project objective', 'directly address overall risk project objective result combined effect risk potential interaction other', 'however achieved use quantitative risk analysis technique see chapter 7. one step analysis categorize risk according source cause', 'several risk arise common source sometimes called root cause risk response may effective focus addressing root cause', 'identifying common effect group risk allows identification area greatest risk exposure example', 'project completion date budget particular deliverable scope facilitating risk response focus area', 'method qualitative risk analysis applied list risk created updated identify risk process provide project management characteristic risk influence positive negative achieving project objective', 'risk assessed high priority either threaten enhance achievement project objective important focus plan risk response process', 'may analyzed analysis overall project risk discussed perform quantitative risk analysis process']","['project risk discussed perform', 'qualitative risk analysis process', 'perform qualitative risk analysis', 'individually identified project risks', 'methods qualitative risk analysis', 'risks process provide project', 'address overall risk project', 'methods qualitative risk', 'qualitative risk analysis evaluates', 'projects objectives risks assessed']","['qualitative risk analysis process', 'perform qualitative risk analysis', 'methods qualitative risk analysis', 'methods qualitative risk', 'qualitative risk analysis evaluates']","['project risk discussed perform', 'individually identified project risks', 'risks process provide project', 'address overall risk project', 'projects objectives risks assessed']"
 Critical Success Factors for the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process,"Several factors that lead to successful qualitative risk analysis are described in Sections 6.2.1 through 6.2.4, and summarized in Figure 6-1. Agreement of the project stakeholders is a fundamental criterion and a common theme. The agreed-upon approach is the foundation of process credibility. Then, agreed-upon definitions enable high-quality information to be collected. Finally, with these conditions in place, the process can be executed reliably, which contributes to the credibility of its outputs. 3 Figure 6 -1.

 Use Agreed Upon Approach,"The process is based on an agreed-upon approach to this assessment that is applied across all of the identified risks in any project. By the nature of project risk, all risks may be assessed according to probability of occurrence and impact on individual objectives should the risk occur. Other factors may be considered in determining the importance of a risk as follows Urgency proximity. Risks requiring near term responses may be considered more urgent to address. Indicators of urgency can include the lead time necessary to execute a risk response and the clarity of symptoms and warning signs also known as detectability that may trigger the response. Manageability. Some risks are not manageable and it would be a waste of resources to attempt to address them. The project team may examine these and decide to Go forward, perhaps establishing a contingency reserve. Stop or re-scope the project because these risks pose an unmanageable threat or an opportunity that should not be missed with high probability and consequences. Inform the customer of the risks and ask for a decision from their point of view. Impact external to the project.

 Use Agreed Upon Definitions of Risk Terms,"The risk assessment should be based on agreed-upon definitions of important terms, and those definitions should be used consistently when assessing each risk.

 Perform Iterative Qualitative Risk Analysis,"The success of qualitative risk analysis is enhanced if the process is used periodically throughout the project.

 Select Risk Characteristics that Define Risks Importance,"Qualitative risk analysis tools provide ways to distinguish those risks that are important for response or further analysis from those that are less important. The criteria that make a risk of interest to management are agreed upon in advance and implemented in the tools used. Output from qualitative risk analysis tools includes a listing of risks in priority order or in priority groups e.g., high, moderate, and low.

 Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Specific Objectives,Some tools permit distinguishing a risks priority in terms of the affected objective. This capability provides a list of risks that are important for any specific objective of interest to management. This is useful since it is common for risks to have uneven impacts on various project objectives.,tools permit distinguishing risks priority terms affected objective. capability provides list risks important specific objective interest management. useful since common risks uneven impacts various project objectives.,[],"['tool permit distinguishing risk priority term affected objective', 'capability provides list risk important specific objective interest management', 'useful since common risk uneven impact various project objective']","['capability provides list risks', 'provides list risks important', 'affected objective capability provides', 'list risks important specific', 'objective capability provides', 'distinguishing risks priority terms', 'risks priority terms', 'list risks important', 'tools permit distinguishing risks', 'risks important specific objective']",[],"['capability provides list risks', 'provides list risks important', 'affected objective capability provides', 'list risks important specific', 'objective capability provides', 'distinguishing risks priority terms', 'risks priority terms', 'list risks important', 'tools permit distinguishing risks', 'risks important specific objective']"
 Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Overall Project,"There are reasons for constructing a measure of a specific risks importance to the entire project as contrasted with its importance to specific objectives. A common reason is for ease of communication with management and other stakeholders. When a single risk prioritization index is needed, the organization should be explicit about how that index is created. Usually the index re ects the organizations preference among objectives. The technique for creating the overall risk priority measure should be documented in the Plan Risk Management process. 3",reasons constructing measure specific risks importance entire project contrasted importance specific objectives. common reason ease communication management stakeholders. single risk prioritization index needed organization explicit index created. usually index ects organizations preference among objectives. technique creating overall risk priority measure documented plan risk management process. 3,[],"['reason constructing measure specific risk importance entire project contrasted importance specific objective', 'common reason ease communication management stakeholder', 'single risk prioritization index needed organization explicit index created', 'usually index ect organization preference among objective', 'technique creating overall risk priority measure documented plan risk management process']","['risk priority measure', 'plan risk management process', 'creating overall risk priority', 'risk prioritization index', 'measure specific risks importance', 'risk prioritization index needed', 'risks importance entire project', 'overall risk priority measure', 'risk management process', 'stakeholders single risk prioritization']",[],"['risk priority measure', 'plan risk management process', 'creating overall risk priority', 'risk prioritization index', 'measure specific risks importance', 'risk prioritization index needed', 'risks importance entire project', 'overall risk priority measure', 'risk management process', 'stakeholders single risk prioritization']"
 Categorize Risk Causes,"Categorizing risks appropriately may lead to improved analysis of the probability and magnitude of project risk and to effective responses. Understanding the relationships between risks may provide a better understanding of the possibility and magnitude of project risk than if risks are only considered as separate and independent events. Identifying common root causes of a group of risks, for instance, may reveal both the magnitude of the risk event for the group as a whole along with effective strategies that might address several risks simultaneously. Alternatively, some risks may be linked with others in a causal chain, and understanding the chain of risks may lead to a better understanding of the implication of risk for the project. Identifying risks that can occur at the same time or using the same resources for recovery might provide a realistic picture of problems of risk mitigation using scarce resources. Combining the results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process with the risk breakdown structure see Identify Risks, Chapter 5 can show clusters of priority risks arising from specific sources. A combination of the risk analysis information with the work breakdown structure WBS can show which areas of the project exhibit the most risk. Assessing the high-priority risks impact on one objective, such as the schedule, may indicate which activities to address to reduce that objectives uncertainty. All of these approaches can contribute to the realism and usefulness of the qualitative risk analysis.",categorizing risks appropriately may lead improved analysis probability magnitude project risk effective responses. understanding relationships risks may provide better understanding possibility magnitude project risk risks considered separate independent events. identifying common root causes group risks instance may reveal magnitude risk event group whole along effective strategies might address several risks simultaneously. alternatively risks may linked others causal chain understanding chain risks may lead better understanding implication risk project. identifying risks occur time using resources recovery might provide realistic picture problems risk mitigation using scarce resources. combining results perform qualitative risk analysis process risk breakdown structure see identify risks chapter 5 show clusters priority risks arising specific sources. combination risk analysis information work breakdown structure wbs show areas project exhibit risk. assessing high-priority risks impact one objective schedule may indicate activities address reduce objectives uncertainty. approaches contribute realism usefulness qualitative risk analysis.,[],"['categorizing risk appropriately may lead improved analysis probability magnitude project risk effective response', 'understanding relationship risk may provide better understanding possibility magnitude project risk risk considered separate independent event', 'identifying common root cause group risk instance may reveal magnitude risk event group whole along effective strategy might address several risk simultaneously', 'alternatively risk may linked others causal chain understanding chain risk may lead better understanding implication risk project', 'identifying risk occur time using resource recovery might provide realistic picture problem risk mitigation using scarce resource', 'combining result perform qualitative risk analysis process risk breakdown structure see identify risk chapter 5 show cluster priority risk arising specific source', 'combination risk analysis information work breakdown structure wb show area project exhibit risk', 'assessing high-priority risk impact one objective schedule may indicate activity address reduce objective uncertainty', 'approach contribute realism usefulness qualitative risk analysis']","['implication risk project identifying', 'project identifying risks occur', 'risk project identifying', 'project risk risks considered', 'risk project identifying risks', 'project risk risks', 'risk analysis process risk', 'project risk effective responses', 'project identifying risks', 'project risk']",[],"['implication risk project identifying', 'project identifying risks occur', 'risk project identifying', 'project risk risks considered', 'risk project identifying risks', 'project risk risks', 'risk analysis process risk', 'project risk effective responses', 'project identifying risks', 'project risk']"
 Document the Results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process,"The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process adds structure to the list of undifferentiated risks see Identify Risks, Chapter 5 into categories of priority. Priorities are usually based on the risks probability of occurring and its potential impact on specific project objectives or on the whole project. Each identified risk is assigned a priority, perhaps by objective or for the entire project. This information is usually stored in the risk register which is easy to use and update with new information. The risk register list of prioritized risks is posted to the project participants who are responsible for further analysis or action to improve the project plan. Risks that are judged to have high priority are segregated for further analysis and response planning and are generally monitored frequently. Risks of low priority to the project may be placed on a watch list and are reviewed less often for changes in their status. 3",perform qualitative risk analysis process adds structure list undifferentiated risks see identify risks chapter 5 categories priority. priorities usually based risks probability occurring potential impact specific project objectives whole project. identified risk assigned priority perhaps objective entire project. information usually stored risk register easy use update new information. risk register list prioritized risks posted project participants responsible analysis action improve project plan. risks judged high priority segregated analysis response planning generally monitored frequently. risks low priority project may placed watch list reviewed less often changes status. 3,[],"['perform qualitative risk analysis process add structure list undifferentiated risk see identify risk chapter 5 category priority', 'priority usually based risk probability occurring potential impact specific project objective whole project', 'identified risk assigned priority perhaps objective entire project', 'information usually stored risk register easy use update new information', 'risk register list prioritized risk posted project participant responsible analysis action improve project plan', 'risk judged high priority segregated analysis response planning generally monitored frequently', 'risk low priority project may placed watch list reviewed le often change status']","['qualitative risk analysis process', 'project identified risk assigned', 'qualitative risk analysis', 'perform qualitative risk analysis', 'risk analysis process', 'prioritized risks posted project', 'objectives project identified risk', 'list prioritized risks', 'project identified risk', 'project plan risks judged']","['qualitative risk analysis process', 'qualitative risk analysis', 'perform qualitative risk analysis']","['project identified risk assigned', 'risk analysis process', 'prioritized risks posted project', 'objectives project identified risk', 'list prioritized risks', 'project identified risk', 'project plan risks judged']"
 PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS,"The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process provides a numerical estimate of the overall effect of risk on the objectives of the project, based on current plans and information, when considering risks simultaneously. Results from this type of analysis can be used to evaluate the likelihood of success in achieving project objectives and to estimate contingency reserves, usually for time and cost that are appropriate to both the risks and the risk tolerance of project stakeholders. It is generally accepted that analyzing uncertainty in the project using quantitative techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation may provide more realism in the estimate of the overall project cost or schedule than a non-probabilistic approach which assumes that the activity durations or line-item cost estimates are deterministic. However it should be recognized that quantitative risk analysis is not always required or appropriate for all projects. For example, qualitative risk analysis may provide enough information for development of effective risk responses, especially for smaller projects. Therefore, during the Plan Risk Management process, the benefits of quantitative risk analysis should be weighed against the effort required to ensure that the additional insights and value justify the additional effort. Partial risk analyses, such as qualitative risk analysis, aim at prioritizing individual risks viewed one at a time and therefore cannot produce measures of overall project risk when all risks are considered simultaneously. Calculating estimates of overall project risk is the focus of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. Specific project risks are usually best understood and quantified at a detailed level such as the line-item cost or schedule activity level. By contrast, project objectives such as achievement of the projects budget or the schedule are specified at a higher level, often at the level of the total project. An overall risk analysis, such as one that uses quantitative techniques, estimates the implication of all quantified risks on project objectives. The implementation of overall risk analysis using quantitative methods requires Complete and accurate representation of the project objectives built up from individual project elements. Examples of these representations include the project schedule or cost estimate. Identifying risks on individual project elements such as schedule activities or line-item costs at a level of detail that lends itself to specific assessment of individual risks. Including generic risks that have a broader effect than individual project elements. Applying a quantitative method such as Monte Carlo simulation or decision tree analysis that incorporates multiple risks simultaneously in determining overall impact on the overall project objective. 3 Results of the quantitative analysis will be compared to the project plan baseline or current to give management an estimate of the overall project risk and will answer important questions such as What is the probability of meeting the projects objectives How much contingency reserve e.g., reserves or buffers of time, resources, and cost is needed to provide the organization with the level of certainty it requires based upon its risk tolerance What are those parts of the project, such as line-item costs or schedule activities, which contribute the most risk when all risks are considered simultaneously Which individual risks contribute the most to overall project risk Estimating overall project risk using quantitative methods helps distinguish those projects where quantified risks threaten objectives beyond the tolerance of the stakeholders, from those for which the objectives are within acceptable tolerances even when risk is considered. The former may be targeted for vigorous risk responses aimed at protecting those objectives most important to the stakeholders.

 Appropriate Project Model,"An appropriate model of the project should be used as the basis for quantitative risk analysis. Project models most frequently used in quantitative risk analysis include the project schedule for time, line-item cost estimates for cost, decision tree for decisions in the face of uncertainty and other total-project models. Quantitative risk analysis is especially sensitive to the completeness and correctness of the model of the project that is used.",appropriate model project used basis quantitative risk analysis. project models frequently used quantitative risk analysis include project schedule time line-item cost estimates cost decision tree decisions face uncertainty total-project models. quantitative risk analysis especially sensitive completeness correctness model project used.,[],"['appropriate model project used basis quantitative risk analysis', 'project model frequently used quantitative risk analysis include project schedule time line-item cost estimate cost decision tree decision face uncertainty total-project model', 'quantitative risk analysis especially sensitive completeness correctness model project used']","['quantitative risk analysis include', 'risk analysis project models', 'risk analysis include project', 'total project models quantitative', 'models quantitative risk analysis', 'project models quantitative', 'quantitative risk analysis project', 'used quantitative risk analysis', 'project models quantitative risk', 'risk analysis project']",['project models quantitative'],"['quantitative risk analysis include', 'risk analysis project models', 'risk analysis include project', 'total project models quantitative', 'models quantitative risk analysis', 'quantitative risk analysis project', 'used quantitative risk analysis', 'project models quantitative risk', 'risk analysis project']"
 Commitment to Collecting High Quality Risk Data,"Often high-quality data about risks are not available in any historic database and should be gathered by interviews, workshops, and other means using expert judgment of those present. Collection of risk data requires resources and time as well as management support.",often high-quality data risks available historic database gathered interviews workshops means using expert judgment present. collection risk data requires resources time well management support.,[],"['often high-quality data risk available historic database gathered interview workshop mean using expert judgment present', 'collection risk data requires resource time well management support']","['quality data risks', 'data risks available', 'collection risk data', 'risk data', 'risks available historic database', 'quality data risks available', 'data risks available historic', 'risk data requires', 'collection risk data requires', 'risk data requires resources']",[],"['quality data risks', 'data risks available', 'collection risk data', 'risk data', 'risks available historic database', 'quality data risks available', 'data risks available historic', 'risk data requires', 'collection risk data requires', 'risk data requires resources']"
 Unbiased Data,"Success in gathering risk analysis data requires the ability to recognize when biases occur and combating that bias or developing other unbiased sources of the data. Bias in risk data can occur for many reasons, but two common sources of bias are cognitive bias and motivational bias.",success gathering risk analysis data requires ability recognize biases occur combating bias developing unbiased sources data. bias risk data occur many reasons two common sources bias cognitive bias motivational bias.,[],"['success gathering risk analysis data requires ability recognize bias occur combating bias developing unbiased source data', 'bias risk data occur many reason two common source bias cognitive bias motivational bias']","['success gathering risk analysis', 'gathering risk analysis', 'gathering risk analysis data', 'sources data bias risk', 'data bias risk data', 'risk analysis data requires', 'risk data', 'data bias risk', 'risk analysis data', 'risk data occur']",[],"['success gathering risk analysis', 'gathering risk analysis', 'gathering risk analysis data', 'sources data bias risk', 'data bias risk data', 'risk analysis data requires', 'risk data', 'data bias risk', 'risk analysis data', 'risk data occur']"
 Overall Project Risk Derived from Individual Risks,"The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is based upon a methodology that correctly derives the overall project risk from the individual risks. In risk analysis of cost and schedule, for example, an appropriate method is Monte Carlo simulation. A decision tree is an appropriate method for making decisions when future events are not certain, using the probability and impact of all risks, and combining their effect to derive an overall project measure such as value or cost. In each of these methods, the risks are specified at the level of the detailed tasks or line-item costs and incorporated into the model of the project to calculate effects on objectives such as schedule or cost for the entire project, by combining those risks. 4",perform quantitative risk analysis process based upon methodology correctly derives overall project risk individual risks. risk analysis cost schedule example appropriate method monte carlo simulation. decision tree appropriate method making decisions future events certain using probability impact risks combining effect derive overall project measure value cost. methods risks specified level detailed tasks line-item costs incorporated model project calculate effects objectives schedule cost entire project combining risks. 4,[],"['perform quantitative risk analysis process based upon methodology correctly derives overall project risk individual risk', 'risk analysis cost schedule example appropriate method monte carlo simulation', 'decision tree appropriate method making decision future event certain using probability impact risk combining effect derive overall project measure value cost', 'method risk specified level detailed task line-item cost incorporated model project calculate effect objective schedule cost entire project combining risk']","['quantitative risk analysis process', 'risk analysis process based', 'risk analysis', 'risk analysis process', 'perform quantitative risk analysis', 'overall project risk', 'derives overall project risk', 'risks risk analysis cost', 'project risk', 'risks risk analysis']","['overall project risk', 'derives overall project risk', 'project risk']","['quantitative risk analysis process', 'risk analysis process based', 'risk analysis', 'risk analysis process', 'perform quantitative risk analysis', 'risks risk analysis cost', 'risks risk analysis']"
 Interrelationships Between Risks in Quantitative Risk Analysis,"Attention should be given to the possibility that the individual risks in the project model are related to each other. For example, several risks may have a common root cause and therefore are likely to occur together. This possibility is sometimes addressed by correlating the risks that are related, ensuring that they generally occur together during the analysis. Another common way to represent the risks which occur together is by using the risk register listing of the risk or root cause and attaching it to several project elements such as schedule activities or cost elements. When a particular risk occurs, the affected elements will all experience the effect of that risk together.",attention given possibility individual risks project model related other. example several risks may common root cause therefore likely occur together. possibility sometimes addressed correlating risks related ensuring generally occur together analysis. another common way represent risks occur together using risk register listing risk root cause attaching several project elements schedule activities cost elements. particular risk occurs affected elements experience effect risk together.,[],"['attention given possibility individual risk project model related other', 'example several risk may common root cause therefore likely occur together', 'possibility sometimes addressed correlating risk related ensuring generally occur together analysis', 'another common way represent risk occur together using risk register listing risk root cause attaching several project element schedule activity cost element', 'particular risk occurs affected element experience effect risk together']","['risks project model related', 'addressed correlating risks related', 'way represent risks occur', 'correlating risks related ensuring', 'represent risks occur', 'related example risks common', 'correlating risks', 'correlating risks related', 'represent risks occur using', 'possibility addressed correlating risks']",[],"['risks project model related', 'addressed correlating risks related', 'way represent risks occur', 'correlating risks related ensuring', 'represent risks occur', 'related example risks common', 'correlating risks', 'correlating risks related', 'represent risks occur using', 'possibility addressed correlating risks']"

 Quantitative Method Appropriate to Analyzing Uncertainty,"Probability models use a quantitative method that addresses uncertainty. Specifically, the methods should be able to handle the way uncertainty is represented, predominantly as probability of an events occurring or as probability distributions for a range of outcomes. A good example of this is the use of Monte Carlo simulation tools that permit the combination of probability distributions of line-item costs or schedule activity durations, many of which are uncertain.",probability models use quantitative method addresses uncertainty. specifically methods able handle way uncertainty represented predominantly probability events occurring probability distributions range outcomes. good example use monte carlo simulation tools permit combination probability distributions line-item costs schedule activity durations many uncertain.,[],"['probability model use quantitative method address uncertainty', 'specifically method able handle way uncertainty represented predominantly probability event occurring probability distribution range outcome', 'good example use monte carlo simulation tool permit combination probability distribution line-item cost schedule activity duration many uncertain']","['uncertainty represented predominantly probability', 'method addresses uncertainty specifically', 'addresses uncertainty specifically methods', 'probability models', 'uncertainty specifically methods able', 'uncertainty specifically methods', 'probability models use quantitative', 'quantitative method addresses uncertainty', 'models use quantitative method', 'probability models use']","['uncertainty specifically methods able', 'uncertainty specifically methods', 'quantitative method addresses uncertainty']","['uncertainty represented predominantly probability', 'method addresses uncertainty specifically', 'addresses uncertainty specifically methods', 'probability models', 'probability models use quantitative', 'models use quantitative method', 'probability models use']"

 Effective Presentation of Quantitative Analysis Results,"Results from the quantitative tools are generally not available in standard deterministic project management methods such as project scheduling or cost estimating. Examples of these are the probability distribution of project completion dates or total costs and the expected value of a project decision. These results, when all risks are considered simultaneously, include the following Probability of achieving a project objective such as finishing on time or within budget. Amount of contingency reserve in cost, time, or resources needed to provide a required level of confidence. Identity or location within the project model of the most important risks.

 Iterative Quantitative Risk Analysis,"The success of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is enhanced if the process is used periodically throughout the project. It is impossible to know in advance all of the risks that may occur in a project. Often quantitative risk analysis should be repeated as the project proceeds.

 Documenting the Results of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis Process,"The contingency reserves calculated in quantitative project cost and schedule risk analysis are incorporated, respectively, into the cost estimate and the schedule to establish a prudent target and a realistic expectation for the project. Contingency reserves may also be established to provide for the capture of opportunities that are judged to be priorities for the project. If the contingency reserve required exceeds the time or resources available, changes in the project scope and plan may result. Also, the results of the analysis may provide more or less urgency to risk response see Plan Risk Responses, Chapter 8 depending on the probability of achieving the plans objectives or the amount of contingency reserve required to provide the necessary level of confidence.

 PLAN RISK RESPONSES,"The Plan Risk Responses process determines effective response actions that are appropriate to the priority of the individual risks and to the overall project risk. It takes into account the stakeholders risk attitudes and the conventions specified in the Risk Management Plan, in addition to any constraints and assumptions that were determined when the risks were identified and analyzed.",plan risk responses process determines effective response actions appropriate priority individual risks overall project risk. takes account stakeholders risk attitudes conventions specified risk management plan addition constraints assumptions determined risks identified analyzed.,[],"['plan risk response process determines effective response action appropriate priority individual risk overall project risk', 'take account stakeholder risk attitude convention specified risk management plan addition constraint assumption determined risk identified analyzed']","['risks overall project risk', 'project risk takes account', 'plan risk responses process', 'risk management plan', 'project risk takes', 'plan risk responses', 'risk responses process determines', 'overall project risk takes', 'risk responses process', 'project risk']","['plan risk responses process', 'risk management plan', 'plan risk responses']","['risks overall project risk', 'project risk takes account', 'project risk takes', 'risk responses process determines', 'overall project risk takes', 'risk responses process', 'project risk']"
 Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Responses Process,"The objective of the Plan Risk Responses process is to determine the set of actions which most enhance the chances of project success while complying with applicable organizational and project constraints. Once risks have been identified, analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be developed for addressing every risk the project team considers to be sufficiently important, either because of the threat it poses to the project objectives or the opportunity it offers. The planning entails agreeing upon the actions to be taken and the potential changes to budget, schedule, resources, and scope which these actions might cause. Contingent risk response actions need to be executed at the optimum time. For this reason, the response specification for each such risk should include a description of any corresponding trigger conditions. The responsibility for monitoring the project conditions and implementing the corresponding actions should be clearly assigned. Every risk should have been allocated to a risk owner as part of the Identify Risks process, and each of the corresponding risk responses should now be assigned to a specific risk action owner. The risk owner is responsible for ensuring that the risk response is effective and for planning additional risk responses if required, whereas the risk action owner is responsible for ensuring that the agreed-upon risk responses are carried out as planned, in a timely manner. The role of the risk owner and that of the risk action owner may be assigned to a single person. Responses, when implemented, can have potential effects on the project objectives and, as such, can generate additional risks. These are known as secondary risks and have to be analyzed and planned for in the same way as those risks which were initially identified. It is never feasible or even desirable to eliminate all threats from a project. Similarly, there is also a limit to the extent to which opportunities can be proactively managed. There may be residual risks that will remain after the responses have been implemented. These residual risks should be clearly identified, analyzed, documented, and communicated to all relevant stakeholders. 4 All the approved, unconditional actions arising from risk response planning should be integrated into the project management plan in order to ensure that they are carried out as part of normal project implementation. The corresponding organizational and project management rules should also be invoked, including the following Project change management and configuration control Project planning, budgeting, and scheduling Resource management and Project communication planning.",objective plan risk responses process determine set actions enhance chances project success complying applicable organizational project constraints. risks identified analyzed prioritized plans developed addressing every risk project team considers sufficiently important either threat poses project objectives opportunity offers. planning entails agreeing upon actions taken potential changes budget schedule resources scope actions might cause. contingent risk response actions need executed optimum time. reason response specification risk include description corresponding trigger conditions. responsibility monitoring project conditions implementing corresponding actions clearly assigned. every risk allocated risk owner part identify risks process corresponding risk responses assigned specific risk action owner. risk owner responsible ensuring risk response effective planning additional risk responses required whereas risk action owner responsible ensuring agreed-upon risk responses carried planned timely manner. role risk owner risk action owner may assigned single person. responses implemented potential effects project objectives generate additional risks. known secondary risks analyzed planned way risks initially identified. never feasible even desirable eliminate threats project. similarly also limit extent opportunities proactively managed. may residual risks remain responses implemented. residual risks clearly identified analyzed documented communicated relevant stakeholders. 4 approved unconditional actions arising risk response planning integrated project management plan order ensure carried part normal project implementation. corresponding organizational project management rules also invoked including following project change management configuration control project planning budgeting scheduling resource management project communication planning.,[],"['objective plan risk response process determine set action enhance chance project success complying applicable organizational project constraint', 'risk identified analyzed prioritized plan developed addressing every risk project team considers sufficiently important either threat pose project objective opportunity offer', 'planning entail agreeing upon action taken potential change budget schedule resource scope action might cause', 'contingent risk response action need executed optimum time', 'reason response specification risk include description corresponding trigger condition', 'responsibility monitoring project condition implementing corresponding action clearly assigned', 'every risk allocated risk owner part identify risk process corresponding risk response assigned specific risk action owner', 'risk owner responsible ensuring risk response effective planning additional risk response required whereas risk action owner responsible ensuring agreed-upon risk response carried planned timely manner', 'role risk owner risk action owner may assigned single person', 'response implemented potential effect project objective generate additional risk', 'known secondary risk analyzed planned way risk initially identified', 'never feasible even desirable eliminate threat project', 'similarly also limit extent opportunity proactively managed', 'may residual risk remain response implemented', 'residual risk clearly identified analyzed documented communicated relevant stakeholder', '4 approved unconditional action arising risk response planning integrated project management plan order ensure carried part normal project implementation', 'corresponding organizational project management rule also invoked including following project change management configuration control project planning budgeting scheduling resource management project communication planning']","['developed addressing risk project', 'risks analyzed planned way', 'plan risk responses process', 'risk project team considers', 'addressing risk project team', 'risks process', 'risk project', 'plan risk responses', 'risk project team', 'addressing risk project']","['plan risk responses process', 'plan risk responses']","['developed addressing risk project', 'risks analyzed planned way', 'risk project team considers', 'addressing risk project team', 'risks process', 'risk project', 'risk project team', 'addressing risk project']"

 Communicate,"Communication with the various stakeholders should be maintained in an open and appropriate manner. The resulting plans are disseminated and approval obtained in order to ensure full acceptance by all stakeholders. In addition, if organizational causes of risks, such as culture, attitudes, or disagreements concerning objectives are present, they should be addressed openly. This may require involving high levels of the organizations management and other stakeholders. 4",communication various stakeholders maintained open appropriate manner. resulting plans disseminated approval obtained order ensure full acceptance stakeholders. addition organizational causes risks culture attitudes disagreements concerning objectives present addressed openly. may require involving high levels organizations management stakeholders. 4,[],"['communication various stakeholder maintained open appropriate manner', 'resulting plan disseminated approval obtained order ensure full acceptance stakeholder', 'addition organizational cause risk culture attitude disagreement concerning objective present addressed openly', 'may require involving high level organization management stakeholder']","['stakeholders maintained open', 'ensure acceptance stakeholders', 'communication various stakeholders', 'management stakeholders', 'various stakeholders', 'objectives present addressed openly', 'communication various stakeholders maintained', 'various stakeholders maintained', 'stakeholders maintained open appropriate', 'various stakeholders maintained open']",[],"['stakeholders maintained open', 'ensure acceptance stakeholders', 'communication various stakeholders', 'management stakeholders', 'various stakeholders', 'objectives present addressed openly', 'communication various stakeholders maintained', 'various stakeholders maintained', 'stakeholders maintained open appropriate', 'various stakeholders maintained open']"
 Clearly Define Risk Related Roles and Responsibilities,"The risk response success will be dependent upon the full support and involvement of the project team and other stakeholders. The key roles for Project Risk Management are those of risk owner and risk action owner. A single risk owner should be assigned to every identified risk, and each agreed-upon risk response should have a single risk action owner. The people with the corresponding responsibilities should be aware of what is expected of them, and the other project stakeholders should understand and accept the needs and authority of these roles. Management may take ownership of risks with political, organizational causes.

 Address the Interaction of Risks and Responses,"Responses may be developed to address risks related either by cause and effect or by common root cause. Categorization of risks, for example by using tools such as the risk breakdown structure, affinity diagram, or other categorizing tools, may help identify and address this situation. There is also a need during the Plan Risk Responses process to consider the risks aggregated during the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process e.g., ten small, related risks combined may pose a big risk to the project, and then to develop generic responses where possible. Another interaction effect that may occur is when one risk, if it occurs, may affect the probability or impact of other risks. Deciding on the response strategy may require a compromise, since some proposed responses may be mutually exclusive or counterproductive. For example mitigating a threat to time could cost money, thereby increasing pressure on the budget. Risk response planning also needs to take a holistic view of all proposed responses and make sure they are coherent. 4 The challenge therefore in planning responses to risks is the need to control the potential effects of the strategy developed for treating the original risk. If this is overlooked, the total level of threat in a project can actually increase, or the potential for opportunities can be compromised.",responses may developed address risks related either cause effect common root cause. categorization risks example using tools risk breakdown structure affinity diagram categorizing tools may help identify address situation. also need plan risk responses process consider risks aggregated perform quantitative risk analysis process example. ten small related risks combined may pose big risk project develop generic responses possible. another interaction effect may occur one risk occurs may affect probability impact risks. deciding response strategy may require compromise since proposed responses may mutually exclusive counterproductive. example mitigating threat time could cost money thereby increasing pressure budget. risk response planning also needs take holistic view proposed responses make sure coherent. 4 challenge therefore planning responses risks need control potential effects strategy developed treating original risk. overlooked total level threat project actually increase potential opportunities compromised.,[],"['response may developed address risk related either cause effect common root cause', 'categorization risk example using tool risk breakdown structure affinity diagram categorizing tool may help identify address situation', 'also need plan risk response process consider risk aggregated perform quantitative risk analysis process example', 'ten small related risk combined may pose big risk project develop generic response possible', 'another interaction effect may occur one risk occurs may affect probability impact risk', 'deciding response strategy may require compromise since proposed response may mutually exclusive counterproductive', 'example mitigating threat time could cost money thereby increasing pressure budget', 'risk response planning also need take holistic view proposed response make sure coherent', '4 challenge therefore planning response risk need control potential effect strategy developed treating original risk', 'overlooked total level threat project actually increase potential opportunity compromised']","['plan risk responses process', 'risk responses process', 'risk response planning', 'plan risk responses', 'need plan risk responses', 'risk project develop', 'planning responses risks need', 'responses developed address risks', 'risk responses process consider', 'risk response planning needs']",[],"['plan risk responses process', 'risk responses process', 'risk response planning', 'plan risk responses', 'need plan risk responses', 'risk project develop', 'planning responses risks need', 'responses developed address risks', 'risk responses process consider', 'risk response planning needs']"

 Develop Strategies before Tactical Responses,"Risk response planning should be carried out in an open-minded manner rather than adopting the first response that seems to be feasible. The responses should be planned at a general, strategic level and the strategy validated and agreed upon, prior to developing the detailed tactical approach. Once the responses have been planned at a strategic level, they should be expanded into actions at the tactical level and integrated into the project management plan e.g., schedule, budget, and resource assignments.

 Ownership and Responsibility Assignment,"The project manager needs to use resource assignment processes to ensure the availability of an owner for each risk and for each response action, so that each associated risk is managed and each corresponding risk response is carried out in a timely and effective manner. To enable risk monitoring to identify the imminence or actual occurrence of the corresponding event, every contingency response strategy should include a set of trigger conditions. The responsibility for monitoring these conditions should be clearly assigned in the Plan Risk Responses process and managed in the Monitor and Control Risks process. 4 The strategic definition of risk responses should include measurable criteria for success of the response. Risk action owners should monitor their assigned risks, take agreed-upon actions as required, and provide the risk owners with relevant information on status or changes to the risk characteristics.

 Purpose and Objectives of the Monitor and Control Risks Process,"The primary objectives of risk monitoring and controlling are to track identified risks, monitor residual risks, identify new risks, ensure that risk response plans are executed at the appropriate time, and evaluate their effectiveness throughout the project life cycle. In addition to tracking and managing the risk response actions, the effectiveness of all of the Project Risk Management processes should be reviewed to provide improvements to the management of the current project as well as future ones. For each risk or set of risks for which a contingent response has been defined, the corresponding set of trigger conditions should have been specified. It is the responsibility of the action owner to ensure that these conditions are effectively monitored and that the corresponding actions are carried out as defined, in a timely manner. Once the Plan Risk Responses process is complete, all of the approved unconditional response actions should have been included and defined in the current project management plan. The first action of risk monitoring and controlling is to check whether this is the case and take any appropriate action if necessary, such as invoking the change management process with respect to any missing actions. This will then ensure that the agreed-upon actions are carried out within the normal project execution framework. The risk owners and risk action owners need to be briefed on any changes that may affect their responsibilities. Effective communication needs to be maintained between them and the project manager so that the designated stakeholders accept accountability for controlling the potential outcomes of specific risks, apply their best efforts to track the associated trigger conditions and carry out the agreed-upon responses in a timely manner. In addition to the response actions and trigger conditions, a mechanism for measuring the effectiveness of the response is provided by the Plan Risk Responses process. The risk action owner should keep the risk owner aware of the status of the response actions so that the risk owner can decide when the risk has been effectively dealt with, or whether additional actions need to be planned and implemented. 5 As the project progresses, additional information becomes available and the project environment may change as some risks occur, whether foreseen or unforeseen, and others become or cease to be relevant. The planning should therefore be kept current and the project manager should ensure that periodic risk reassessment, including risk identification, analysis, and response planning, is repeated at reasonable intervals, or in response to project eventswithout generating excessive administrative overhead. Typical reasons for risk reassessment are Occurrence of a major or unexpected risk, Need to analyze a complex change request, Phase end review, Project re-planning or major plan elaboration, and Periodic review to ensure that the information remains current. In the event of major organizational changes, risk management planning may need to be revisited prior to reassessing the risks. In addition to the regular status reviews, periodic audits should be performed to determine strengths and weaknesses in handling risks within the project. This should entail identifying any barriers to effectiveness or keys to success in risk management, recognition of which could lead to improvements in risk management of the current or future projects. At the end of the project, an integrated analysis of the risk management process should be carried out with a focus on long-term process improvements. This analysis consolidates the findings of the periodic audits to identify lessons that would be applicable in general to a large proportion of the organizations projects in the future, such as appropriate levels of resources, adequate time for the analysis, use of tools, level of detail, etc. At project closure, the project manager should ensure that a description has been given of the closure of every risk in the risk register, for example a did not occur b occurred and contingency plan invoked or c occurred and impact to the project scope i.e., time, cost, and quality. The output of the audit of the risk management process should be consolidated with specific information with respect to the projects experience of risks, and any generally applicable guidelines for the organization should be highlighted and potential actions proposed for applying them.

 Integrate Risk Monitoring and Control with Project Monitoring and Control,"From the start, the project management plan should include the actions required to monitor and control project risk. This should be set up early in the project planning cycle, and then adjusted in view of the risk response planning decisions adding, for example, the actions associated with monitoring specific conditions or metrics. Once risk response planning has been carried out, the project schedule should include all of the agreed-upon, response-related actions so that they can be carried out as a normal part of project execution and tracked accordingly. 5",start project management plan include actions required monitor control project risk. set early project planning cycle adjusted view risk response planning decisions adding example actions associated monitoring specific conditions metrics. risk response planning carried project schedule include agreed-upon response-related actions carried normal part project execution tracked accordingly. 5,[],"['start project management plan include action required monitor control project risk', 'set early project planning cycle adjusted view risk response planning decision adding example action associated monitoring specific condition metric', 'risk response planning carried project schedule include agreed-upon response-related action carried normal part project execution tracked accordingly']","['start project management', 'control project risk', 'project planning cycle', 'start project management plan', 'project management plan include', 'set early project planning', 'project management', 'project management plan', 'project planning', 'early project planning']",[],"['start project management', 'control project risk', 'project planning cycle', 'start project management plan', 'project management plan include', 'set early project planning', 'project management', 'project management plan', 'project planning', 'early project planning']"
 Continuously Monitor Risk Trigger Conditions,"Risk response planning will have defined a set of actions to be carried out as part of the project schedule as well as actions whose execution is dependent on a predefined trigger condition. Checking for specifically defined risks that may trigger conditional responses is the responsibility of the risk action owner, in close collaboration with the risk owner under the overall authority of the project manager.",risk response planning defined set actions carried part project schedule well actions whose execution dependent predefined trigger condition. checking specifically defined risks may trigger conditional responses responsibility risk action owner close collaboration risk owner overall authority project manager.,[],"['risk response planning defined set action carried part project schedule well action whose execution dependent predefined trigger condition', 'checking specifically defined risk may trigger conditional response responsibility risk action owner close collaboration risk owner overall authority project manager']","['risk response planning defined', 'responsibility risk action', 'response planning defined set', 'responses responsibility risk action', 'response planning defined', 'response planning', 'risk response', 'conditional responses responsibility risk', 'risk response planning', 'responses responsibility risk']",[],"['risk response planning defined', 'responsibility risk action', 'response planning defined set', 'responses responsibility risk action', 'response planning defined', 'response planning', 'risk response', 'conditional responses responsibility risk', 'risk response planning', 'responses responsibility risk']"
 Maintain Risk Awareness,"Risk management reports should be a regular item on every status meeting agenda to ensure that all team members remain aware of the importance of risk management and to ensure that it is fully integrated into all of the project management decisions. The projects senior-level sponsor should require regular reports on the risks and the planned responses to ensure that stakeholders are aware of the importance of keeping a focus on risk. Sponsor feedback also motivates the project team by demonstrating senior-level interest in Project Risk Management. Stakeholders perception of the effectiveness of risk management is conditioned in part by the way in which risks are handled as they occur, and by the number or characteristics of such events. It is therefore crucial, whenever a risk occurs, that information about the event, as well as the progress and effectiveness of the responses, be communicated at regular intervals and in an honest manner adapted to the needs of each stakeholder. This should be supported by a well-executed communications plan.",risk management reports regular item every status meeting agenda ensure team members remain aware importance risk management ensure fully integrated project management decisions. projects senior-level sponsor require regular reports risks planned responses ensure stakeholders aware importance keeping focus risk. sponsor feedback also motivates project team demonstrating senior-level interest project risk management. stakeholders perception effectiveness risk management conditioned part way risks handled occur number characteristics events. therefore crucial whenever risk occurs information event well progress effectiveness responses communicated regular intervals honest manner adapted needs stakeholder. supported well-executed communications plan.,[],"['risk management report regular item every status meeting agenda ensure team member remain aware importance risk management ensure fully integrated project management decision', 'project senior-level sponsor require regular report risk planned response ensure stakeholder aware importance keeping focus risk', 'sponsor feedback also motivates project team demonstrating senior-level interest project risk management', 'stakeholder perception effectiveness risk management conditioned part way risk handled occur number characteristic event', 'therefore crucial whenever risk occurs information event well progress effectiveness response communicated regular interval honest manner adapted need stakeholder', 'supported well-executed communication plan']","['project risk management stakeholders', 'project risk management', 'risk management', 'level project risk management', 'senior level project risk', 'risk management reports', 'level project risk', 'importance risk management ensure', 'risk management stakeholders', 'project risk']",[],"['project risk management stakeholders', 'project risk management', 'risk management', 'level project risk management', 'senior level project risk', 'risk management reports', 'level project risk', 'importance risk management ensure', 'risk management stakeholders', 'project risk']"

 Managing Contingency Reserves,"Reserves may have been allocated separately to cover time-related and cost-related risks. Techniques are required that allow the project manager to assess at any point in the project whether these provide the required level of confidence in the success of the project. Tools for managing time buffers should be closely integrated into the projects scheduling techniques, whereas those for managing cost should be compatible with the financial practices. Tools are required to identify trends and forecast future outcomes to determine whether the reserves will remain sufficient. Tools are also required for tracking progress and spending in a consolidated manner. 5",reserves may allocated separately cover time-related cost-related risks. techniques required allow project manager assess point project whether provide required level confidence success project. tools managing time buffers closely integrated projects scheduling techniques whereas managing cost compatible financial practices. tools required identify trends forecast future outcomes determine whether reserves remain sufficient. tools also required tracking progress spending consolidated manner. 5,[],"['reserve may allocated separately cover time-related cost-related risk', 'technique required allow project manager ass point project whether provide required level confidence success project', 'tool managing time buffer closely integrated project scheduling technique whereas managing cost compatible financial practice', 'tool required identify trend forecast future outcome determine whether reserve remain sufficient', 'tool also required tracking progress spending consolidated manner']","['reserves allocated separately cover', 'techniques managing cost', 'future outcomes determine reserves', 'determine reserves', 'reserves allocated separately', 'projects scheduling techniques', 'projects scheduling techniques managing', 'outcomes determine reserves', 'managing cost', 'reserves allocated']",[],"['reserves allocated separately cover', 'techniques managing cost', 'future outcomes determine reserves', 'determine reserves', 'reserves allocated separately', 'projects scheduling techniques', 'projects scheduling techniques managing', 'outcomes determine reserves', 'managing cost', 'reserves allocated']"
 Tracking Trigger Conditions,"Trigger conditions and the corresponding metrics are defined during the Plan Risk Responses process.

 Documenting the Results of the Monitor and Control Risks Process,"The final control action of risk monitoring and controlling is to record actual data for future use. This includes all of the relevant information relating to risk management from start to finish of the project. The definition of what this information must include, as well as the storage mechanism, should have been previously specified in the risk management plan. The goal is to ensure that the significant risk management information is recorded to provide concrete data to the lessons learned process for inclusion in a lessons learned document, report, or other communication vehicle. Typical information includes the following For each identified risk or type of risk, whether it occurred, and, if so, when and how often. All relevant data should be recorded impact, effectiveness of detection and of response, and any unplanned, additional actions that were carried out. Effectiveness of avoidance or exploitation actions. Effectiveness of transfer and sharing actions. Unexpected or undocumented risks which occurred and data about them. Effectiveness of risk mitigation and enhancement actions. Occurrence of accepted threats or opportunities. Consolidated information should be provided on the level of effort expended.

 GUIDELINES FOR A PMI PRACTICE STANDARD,"A PMI practice standard is characterized as follows Each practice standard provides guidelines on the mechanics e.g., nuts and bolts, basics, fundamentals, step-by-step usage guide, how it operates, how to do it of some significant process input, tool, technique, or output that is relevant to a project manager. A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the life-cycle phases of many projects however, an individual practice standard may be applicable to the completion of one or more phases within a project. A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the Knowledge Areas within A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition, although an individual practice standard will provide sufficient detail and background for one or more of the inputs, tools and techniques, andor outputs. Therefore, practice standards are not required to use the name of any Knowledge Area. Each practice standard should include information on what the significant process is and does, why it is significant, how to perform it, when it should be performed, and, if necessary for further clarification, who should perform it. Each practice standard should include information that is accepted and applicable for most projects most of the time within the project management community. Processes that are generally restricted or applicable to one industry, country, or companion profession i.e., an application area may be included as an appendix for informational purposes, rather than as part of the practice standard. With strong support and evidence, an application area-specific process may be considered as an extension practice standard, in the same manner as extensions to the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition are considered. Each practice standard will benefit from the inclusion of examples and templates. It is best when an example or template includes a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses. A background description may be necessary to put this discussion in the appropriate context. The examples should be aligned with the relevant information in the standard or its appendix and placed in proximity to that information. All practice standards shall be written in the same general style and format. E ach practice standard project will be aligned with or reference other practice standards, as needed. Each practice standard will be consistent with the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. Each practice standard is intended to be more prescriptive than the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. 59B",pmi practice standard characterized follows practice standard provides guidelines mechanics example. nuts bolts basics fundamentals step-by-step usage guide operates significant process input tool technique output relevant project manager. practice standard necessarily mirror life-cycle phases many projects however individual practice standard may applicable completion one phases within project. practice standard necessarily mirror knowledge areas within guide project management body knowledge pmbok guide fourth edition although individual practice standard provide sufficient detail background one inputs tools techniques andor outputs. therefore practice standards required use name knowledge area. practice standard include information significant process significant perform performed necessary clarification perform it. practice standard include information accepted applicable projects time within project management community. processes generally restricted applicable one industry country companion profession i.e. application area may included appendix informational purposes rather part practice standard. strong support evidence application area-specific process may considered extension practice standard manner extensions pmbok guide fourth edition considered. practice standard benefit inclusion examples templates. best example template includes discussion strengths weaknesses. background description may necessary put discussion appropriate context. examples aligned relevant information standard appendix placed proximity information. practice standards shall written general style format. e ach practice standard project aligned reference practice standards needed. practice standard consistent pmbok guide fourth edition. practice standard intended prescriptive pmbok guide fourth edition. 59b,[],"['pmi practice standard characterized follows practice standard provides guideline mechanic example', 'nut bolt basic fundamental step-by-step usage guide operates significant process input tool technique output relevant project manager', 'practice standard necessarily mirror life-cycle phase many project however individual practice standard may applicable completion one phase within project', 'practice standard necessarily mirror knowledge area within guide project management body knowledge pmbok guide fourth edition although individual practice standard provide sufficient detail background one input tool technique andor output', 'therefore practice standard required use name knowledge area', 'practice standard include information significant process significant perform performed necessary clarification perform it', 'practice standard include information accepted applicable project time within project management community', 'process generally restricted applicable one industry country companion profession i', 'e', 'application area may included appendix informational purpose rather part practice standard', 'strong support evidence application area-specific process may considered extension practice standard manner extension pmbok guide fourth edition considered', 'practice standard benefit inclusion example template', 'best example template includes discussion strength weakness', 'background description may necessary put discussion appropriate context', 'example aligned relevant information standard appendix placed proximity information', 'practice standard shall written general style format', 'e ach practice standard project aligned reference practice standard needed', 'practice standard consistent pmbok guide fourth edition', 'practice standard intended prescriptive pmbok guide fourth edition']","['pmi practice', 'pmi practice standard', 'standards needed practice standard', 'practice standard provides guidelines', 'project practice standard', 'projects individual practice standard', 'pmi practice standard characterized', 'project practice standard necessarily', 'phases project practice standard', 'project manager practice standard']","['pmi practice standard', 'pmi practice standard characterized']","['pmi practice', 'standards needed practice standard', 'practice standard provides guidelines', 'project practice standard', 'projects individual practice standard', 'project practice standard necessarily', 'phases project practice standard', 'project manager practice standard']"
 EVOLUTION OF PMIS PRACTICE STANDARD FOR PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT,"B.1 Pre-Project In early 2005, PMI began exploration for developing the first Practice Standard for Project Risk Management. Focus would be placed on single project risk management for a single project rather than including programs or portfolios of projects, with close coupling to the Project Risk Management section of A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge PMBOK Guide Third Edition. By April 20, 2006, the PMI Standards Members Advisory Group MAG approved the following final charter for the standard, with Cynthia A. Berg, PMP , as the Project Manager, and Dr. David Hulett as the Deputy Project Manager. The charter included the following characteristics for the standard Provides information on Project Risk Management that includes information that is clear, complete, relevant, and generally recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time. Is consistent with the PMBOK Guide Third Edition, expanding but not contradicting, the concepts and techniques related to Project Risk Management, and keeps within the limits and practices of Project Risk Management as described within Chapter 11 of the PMBOK Guide Third Edition. Has been reviewed and updated by the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management Project Team. Is written for project management practitioners and other stakeholders of the project management profession. Describes the processes that are unique to Project Risk Management. Includes in an appendix, examples and templates of specific Project Risk Management processes, tools, andor techniques addressed in the practice standard, with discussions of their strengths and weaknesses, including background descriptions that put the relative strengths and weaknesses into context. Uses the PMBOK Guide Third Edition Glossary as the starting point of its glossary, and does not contain contradictions. Uses a glossary term in the text without definition or additional explanation. Is aligned with and does not contradict other PMI standards. Follows the PMI Style Guide, is written in North American English, translatable to PMI official languages, and is sensitive to cultural issues. 60B Can be approved as a PMI standard, which means that in addition to the content being acceptable, the process for selecting team members and soliciting and responding to comments on the product must be open and inclusive.",b.1 pre-project early 2005 pmi began exploration developing first practice standard project risk management. focus would placed single project risk management single project rather including programs portfolios projects close coupling project risk management section guide project management body knowledge pmbok guide third edition. april 20 2006 pmi standards members advisory group mag approved following final charter standard cynthia a. berg pmp project manager dr. david hulett deputy project manager. charter included following characteristics standard provides information project risk management includes information clear complete relevant generally recognized good practice projects time. consistent pmbok guide third edition expanding contradicting concepts techniques related project risk management keeps within limits practices project risk management described within chapter 11 pmbok guide third edition. reviewed updated practice standard project risk management project team. written project management practitioners stakeholders project management profession. describes processes unique project risk management. includes appendix examples templates specific project risk management processes tools andor techniques addressed practice standard discussions strengths weaknesses including background descriptions put relative strengths weaknesses context. uses pmbok guide third edition glossary starting point glossary contain contradictions. uses glossary term text without definition additional explanation. aligned contradict pmi standards. follows pmi style guide written north american english translatable pmi official languages sensitive cultural issues. 60b approved pmi standard means addition content acceptable process selecting team members soliciting responding comments product must open inclusive.,[],"['b.1 pre-project early 2005 pmi began exploration developing first practice standard project risk management', 'focus would placed single project risk management single project rather including program portfolio project close coupling project risk management section guide project management body knowledge pmbok guide third edition', 'april 20 2006 pmi standard member advisory group mag approved following final charter standard cynthia a', 'berg pmp project manager dr', 'david hulett deputy project manager', 'charter included following characteristic standard provides information project risk management includes information clear complete relevant generally recognized good practice project time', 'consistent pmbok guide third edition expanding contradicting concept technique related project risk management keep within limit practice project risk management described within chapter 11 pmbok guide third edition', 'reviewed updated practice standard project risk management project team', 'written project management practitioner stakeholder project management profession', 'describes process unique project risk management', 'includes appendix example template specific project risk management process tool andor technique addressed practice standard discussion strength weakness including background description put relative strength weakness context', 'us pmbok guide third edition glossary starting point glossary contain contradiction', 'us glossary term text without definition additional explanation', 'aligned contradict pmi standard', 'follows pmi style guide written north american english translatable pmi official language sensitive cultural issue', '60b approved pmi standard mean addition content acceptable process selecting team member soliciting responding comment product must open inclusive']","['standard project risk management', 'project risk management', 'project risk management processes', 'project risk management described', 'related project risk management', 'project risk management project', 'practices project risk management', 'project risk management includes', 'practice standard project risk', 'project risk management section']",[],"['standard project risk management', 'project risk management', 'project risk management processes', 'project risk management described', 'related project risk management', 'project risk management project', 'practices project risk management', 'project risk management includes', 'practice standard project risk', 'project risk management section']"

The Risk Management Plan Purpose and Typical Content," Depending on the size and complexity of the project, some or all of the following elements will be present in a risk management plan. Introduction Project Description Project objectives External dependencies Stakeholder analysis Risk Management Scope and Objectives Variance thresholds Prioritization of project objectives Thresholds, weights and other parameters Definition of criteria for unacceptable threats and un-missable opportunities Impact scales, probability scales, PxI matrices, weighting of project objectives, prioritization and selection criteria, degree of confidence required for overall risk e.g., 80 th percentile from quantitative risk analysis Risk Management Methodology Relationship with the organizational environment Risk management activities Link to the project management methodology Relationship with other project management processes Risk taxonomyrisk breakdown structure either

Templates Relevant to Risk Management Planning," The risk management plan should provide a number of templates for use by the other processes. These may include Formal structure for a risk statement An example is given below Means of categorizing risks, for example a risk breakdown structure An example is given in the Identify Risks section of this appendix Definitions, by project objective, of probability and impact scales An example is given in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis section of this appendix Risk prioritization and selection guidelines These guidelines may be used in Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis and in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis as well as in Plan Risk Response Planning.

Risk Statement Metalanguage," In order for all risks to be clearly defined, a standard structure for the way in which the risk is described should be specified and applied. A typical such statement is Because of one or more causes, risk might occur, which would lead to one or more effects. 72D",order risks clearly defined standard structure way risk described specified applied. typical statement one causes risk might occur would lead one effects. 72d,[],"['order risk clearly defined standard structure way risk described specified applied', 'typical statement one cause risk might occur would lead one effect']","['order risks', 'order risks clearly', 'risk described', 'risks clearly defined', 'risk described specified applied', 'order risks clearly defined', 'risk described specified', 'way risk described specified', 'way risk described', 'structure way risk described']",[],"['order risks', 'order risks clearly', 'risk described', 'risks clearly defined', 'risk described specified applied', 'order risks clearly defined', 'risk described specified', 'way risk described specified', 'way risk described', 'structure way risk described']"
Risk Prioritization and Selection Guidelines," The selection and prioritization of risks must be linked to the project objectives. The risk management plan will define the relative importance to be assigned to these objectives e.g. reliability takes precedence over time, etc. this may be in the form of numerical weights that can be applied to create a single weighted sum over all objectives for each risk. Any other features that may affect the urgency of dealing with a risk should also be specified e.g. one linked to a resource that will soon disappear should be given greater urgency.",selection prioritization risks must linked project objectives. risk management plan define relative importance assigned objectives example. reliability takes precedence time etc. may form numerical weights applied create single weighted sum objectives risk. features may affect urgency dealing risk also specified example. one linked resource soon disappear given greater urgency.,[],"['selection prioritization risk must linked project objective', 'risk management plan define relative importance assigned objective example', 'reliability take precedence time etc', 'may form numerical weight applied create single weighted sum objective risk', 'feature may affect urgency dealing risk also specified example', 'one linked resource soon disappear given greater urgency']","['project objectives risk management', 'prioritization risks linked project', 'objectives risk management', 'risks linked project objectives', 'prioritization risks', 'project objectives risk', 'prioritization risks linked', 'linked project objectives risk', 'selection prioritization risks', 'selection prioritization risks linked']","['prioritization risks', 'prioritization risks linked', 'selection prioritization risks', 'selection prioritization risks linked']","['project objectives risk management', 'prioritization risks linked project', 'objectives risk management', 'risks linked project objectives', 'project objectives risk', 'linked project objectives risk']"

Basis for development of pre-emptive and comprehensive responses Can serve to reduce apparent complexityMost risk management techniques are organized by individual risk. This organization is not conducive to identifying the root causes Can oversimplify and hide existence of other potential causes There may be no valid strategy available for addressing the root cause once it has been identified.Ability to identify if a risk is an outcome of a more fundamental cause Willingness by management to accept and address the root cause rather than adopting partial workarounds SWOT Analysis Ensures equal focus on both threats and opportunities Offers a structured approach to identify threats and opportunities Focus on internal organizational strengths and weaknesses and external opportunities and threatsFocuses on internally generated risks arising from organizational strengths and weaknesses, excludes external risks Tends to produce high- level generic risks, not project-specificGood facilitation Strict adherence to the technique, to avoid confusing the four SWOT perspectives i.e. between Strengths and Opportunities, or between Weaknesses and Threats continued Table D2.

Assumptions and Constraints Analysis," This technique requires three steps 1. List assumptions and constraints for the project 2. Test assumptions and constraints by asking two questions a. Could the assumptionconstraint be false b. If it were false, would one or more project objectives be affected positively or negatively 3. Where both questions are answered Yes, generate a risk, for example in the form Assumption constraint may prove false, leading to effect on objectives. The results can be documented in table form, as shown in Figure D1. Table D2. Identify Risks continued 77D Figure D1.

Brainstorming," Brainstorming is commonly used in a facilitated risk identification workshop to identify risks. The standard rules of brainstorming are often modified when the technique is applied to risk identification. For example it is common to structure the risk identification brainstorm using risk categories or a risk breakdown structure. Some evaluation of proposed risks is often included in a risk identification brainstorm to remove non-risks. It is important to ensure active participation of relevant stakeholders in a risk identification brainstorm, and for the facilitator to manage group dynamics carefully. No templates or examples are presented in this appendix.",brainstorming commonly used facilitated risk identification workshop identify risks. standard rules brainstorming often modified technique applied risk identification. example common structure risk identification brainstorm using risk categories risk breakdown structure. evaluation proposed risks often included risk identification brainstorm remove non-risks. important ensure active participation relevant stakeholders risk identification brainstorm facilitator manage group dynamics carefully. templates examples presented appendix.,[],"['brainstorming commonly used facilitated risk identification workshop identify risk', 'standard rule brainstorming often modified technique applied risk identification', 'example common structure risk identification brainstorm using risk category risk breakdown structure', 'evaluation proposed risk often included risk identification brainstorm remove non-risks', 'important ensure active participation relevant stakeholder risk identification brainstorm facilitator manage group dynamic carefully', 'template example presented appendix']","['facilitated risk identification workshop', 'workshop identify risks', 'stakeholders risk identification brainstorm', 'included risk identification brainstorm', 'risk identification brainstorm using', 'risk identification brainstorm', 'risk identification workshop identify', 'risk identification brainstorm facilitator', 'workshop identify risks standard', 'risk identification workshop']",[],"['facilitated risk identification workshop', 'workshop identify risks', 'stakeholders risk identification brainstorm', 'included risk identification brainstorm', 'risk identification brainstorm using', 'risk identification brainstorm', 'risk identification workshop identify', 'risk identification brainstorm facilitator', 'workshop identify risks standard', 'risk identification workshop']"
Cause and Effect Ishikawa Diagrams," This technique presents in diagrammatic form the causes which contribute to a given outcome. Each main cause can be split further into sub-causes. To use this technique for risk identification the outcome should be stated as an effect on a project objective, i.e. the impact of a risk. The diagram then identifies risks as those uncertain events which could result in occurrence of the impact. Care needs to be taken when using this technique for risk identification to distinguish between risks uncertain causes of the impact and issues certain causes of the impact. An example cause and effect Ishikawa diagram is shown below the risk effect to be analyzed is staff leaving the project the main causes are Environment, Ambition, Career Prospects, Satisfaction, Remuneration.

Checklists," Checklists are compiled to capture previous project experience and allow it to be used for subsequent similar projects. It is possible to structure the risk identification checklist around a risk breakdown structure, as shown in the partial example below. It is useful to present the checklist as a set of risks, each of which is considered in turn to determine whether it might be relevant to the project under consideration. Risk identification checklists should include both threats and opportunities. . Figure D3.

Delphi Technique," The Delphi technique uses a facilitated anonymous polling of subject matter experts to identify risks in their area of expertise. The facilitator gathers the experts initial responses and circulates them without attribution to the group, who may revise their contributions based on those of others. The process often generates a consensus of the experts in a few iterations. No templates or examples are presented.",delphi technique uses facilitated anonymous polling subject matter experts identify risks area expertise. facilitator gathers experts initial responses circulates without attribution group may revise contributions based others. process often generates consensus experts iterations. templates examples presented.,[],"['delphi technique us facilitated anonymous polling subject matter expert identify risk area expertise', 'facilitator gather expert initial response circulates without attribution group may revise contribution based others', 'process often generates consensus expert iteration', 'template example presented']","['delphi technique', 'delphi technique uses', 'polling subject matter experts', 'expertise facilitator gathers experts', 'delphi technique uses facilitated', 'process generates consensus experts', 'experts identify risks area', 'experts identify risks', 'gathers experts initial responses', 'generates consensus experts']","['delphi technique', 'delphi technique uses', 'delphi technique uses facilitated']","['polling subject matter experts', 'expertise facilitator gathers experts', 'process generates consensus experts', 'experts identify risks area', 'experts identify risks', 'gathers experts initial responses', 'generates consensus experts']"
Document Review," Risks can be identified through careful review of project documentation, including the project charter, statement of work, contract terms and conditions, subcontracts, technical specifications, regulatory requirements, legal stipulations etc where relevant. Formal structured methods of document review can be used such as the Fagan Inspection Process, or a more informal approach may be adopted.

FMEAFault Tree Analysis," Failure Modes and Effects Analysis FMEA or Fault Tree Analysis is the analysis of a model structured to identify the various elements that can cause system failure by themselves, or in combination with others, 79D based on the logic of the system. Fault tree analysis is typically used in engineering contexts. It can be adapted for use to identify risks by analyzing how risk impacts might arise. Another result is the probability of failure or of reliability, mean time between failure, etc. of the overall system, indicating the level of quality of the system or product. If the level of reliability is not acceptable, the Fault Tree can indicate where the system can be made more reliabletherefore, it is useful in the design and engineering phase of the project. An example is shown below. Figure D4.

Force Field Analysis, Force Field Analysis is typically used in the change management context. It can be adapted for risk identification by identifying driving forces forces for change and restraining forces forces against change which currently affect achievement of a project objective. Risks can then be identified as uncertain events or conditions which would lead to a change in the strength of one or more of the identified forces. An example force field diagram is shown below. 80D Figure D5. Example of a Force Field Analysis and the Balance of Forces For and Against Change,force field analysis typically used change management context. adapted risk identification identifying driving forces forces change restraining forces forces change currently affect achievement project objective. risks identified uncertain events conditions would lead change strength one identified forces. example force field diagram shown below. 80d figure d5. example force field analysis balance forces change,['https://i.ibb.co/SyW3TZT/page-92-png-roi-0-0-99.jpg'],"['force field analysis typically used change management context', 'adapted risk identification identifying driving force force change restraining force force change currently affect achievement project objective', 'risk identified uncertain event condition would lead change strength one identified force', 'example force field diagram shown below', '80d figure d5. example force field analysis balance force change']","['analysis typically used change', 'example force field analysis', 'forces change currently affect', 'field analysis', 'example force field diagram', 'forces example force field', 'field analysis typically used', 'force field analysis', 'force field analysis typically', 'field analysis typically']","['example force field analysis', 'force field analysis', 'force field analysis typically']","['analysis typically used change', 'forces change currently affect', 'field analysis', 'example force field diagram', 'forces example force field', 'field analysis typically used', 'field analysis typically']"

Post-Project ReviewsLessons LearnedHistorical Information," Information relevant to risks for a current project can be obtained by reviewing databases of risks which occurred in previous similar situations. Such databases might arise from post-project reviews or lessons learned exercises. They may also exist as repositories of historical information, either within an organization or industry body. No templates or examples are presented. 82D",information relevant risks current project obtained reviewing databases risks occurred previous similar situations. databases might arise post-project reviews lessons learned exercises. may also exist repositories historical information either within organization industry body. templates examples presented. 82d,[],"['information relevant risk current project obtained reviewing database risk occurred previous similar situation', 'database might arise post-project review lesson learned exercise', 'may also exist repository historical information either within organization industry body', 'template example presented']","['relevant risks current project', 'information relevant risks', 'project obtained reviewing databases', 'databases risks', 'information relevant risks current', 'risks current project', 'reviewing databases risks occurred', 'risks current project obtained', 'obtained reviewing databases risks', 'reviewing databases risks']",[],"['relevant risks current project', 'information relevant risks', 'project obtained reviewing databases', 'databases risks', 'information relevant risks current', 'risks current project', 'reviewing databases risks occurred', 'risks current project obtained', 'obtained reviewing databases risks', 'reviewing databases risks']"
Prompt Lists," A prompt list is a set of risk categories which can be used to stimulate risk identification. The prompt list may be presented as a risk breakdown structure see below, or as a set of headings. A number of standard prompt lists have been developed for use in risk identification, and some of these are presented below. These can then be used as a framework for other risk identification techniques such as brainstorming see D.2.1.2 or risk interviews see D2.1.11. 1.

Risk Breakdown Structure RBS," The risk breakdown structure RBS is a hierarchical framework of potential sources of risk to a project. An organization may develop a generic RBS for use across all its projects, or a project may use a project-specific RBS. A partial example RBS is shown below. Figure D7. Example of a Generic Risk Breakdown Structure 84D",risk breakdown structure rbs hierarchical framework potential sources risk project. organization may develop generic rbs use across projects project may use project-specific rbs. partial example rbs shown below. figure d7. example generic risk breakdown structure 84d,['https://i.ibb.co/sVKWJMx/page-95-png-roi-0-0-99.jpg'],"['risk breakdown structure rb hierarchical framework potential source risk project', 'organization may develop generic rb use across project project may use project-specific rb', 'partial example rb shown below', 'figure d7. example generic risk breakdown structure 84d']","['breakdown structure rbs hierarchical', 'risk breakdown structure 84d', 'example generic risk breakdown', 'risk breakdown structure', 'structure rbs hierarchical', 'generic risk breakdown structure', 'rbs hierarchical framework', 'sources risk project organization', 'risk breakdown structure rbs', 'structure rbs hierarchical framework']",['risk breakdown structure rbs'],"['breakdown structure rbs hierarchical', 'risk breakdown structure 84d', 'example generic risk breakdown', 'risk breakdown structure', 'structure rbs hierarchical', 'generic risk breakdown structure', 'rbs hierarchical framework', 'sources risk project organization', 'structure rbs hierarchical framework']"
Root-Cause Analysis," A root cause analysis seeks to identify basic causes of risks that may be visible symptoms of more fundamental forces. It may also identify common sources of several risks, leading to broad-reaching risk response strategies. Similarly, care needs to be taken when using this technique for risk identification to distinguish between risks uncertain causes of the impact and issues certain causes of the impact. In the diagram shown below the risks that were initially identified included rework, extra cost, schedule slips, low team morale, customer mistrust and repeated audits. An examination of the identified risks lead to a common root cause, that later phases of the project were typically started before the earlier ones were sufficiently mature. This organization repeatedly ignored the proper phase entry prerequisites, hastening later project stages in order to speed up the project. Figure D8. Example of a Root Cause Analysis",root cause analysis seeks identify basic causes risks may visible symptoms fundamental forces. may also identify common sources several risks leading broad-reaching risk response strategies. similarly care needs taken using technique risk identification distinguish risks uncertain causes impact issues certain causes impact. diagram shown risks initially identified included rework extra cost schedule slips low team morale customer mistrust repeated audits. examination identified risks lead common root cause later phases project typically started earlier ones sufficiently mature. organization repeatedly ignored proper phase entry prerequisites hastening later project stages order speed project. figure d8. example root cause analysis,['https://i.ibb.co/Tgkyy07/page-96-png-roi-0-1-00.jpg'],"['root cause analysis seek identify basic cause risk may visible symptom fundamental force', 'may also identify common source several risk leading broad-reaching risk response strategy', 'similarly care need taken using technique risk identification distinguish risk uncertain cause impact issue certain cause impact', 'diagram shown risk initially identified included rework extra cost schedule slip low team morale customer mistrust repeated audit', 'examination identified risk lead common root cause later phase project typically started earlier one sufficiently mature', 'organization repeatedly ignored proper phase entry prerequisite hastening later project stage order speed project', 'figure d8. example root cause analysis']","['example root cause', 'root cause analysis seeks', 'root cause analysis', 'identify basic causes risks', 'example root cause analysis', 'identify basic causes', 'cause analysis seeks identify', 'risks uncertain causes', 'cause analysis', 'cause analysis seeks']","['root cause analysis seeks', 'root cause analysis', 'example root cause analysis']","['example root cause', 'identify basic causes risks', 'identify basic causes', 'cause analysis seeks identify', 'risks uncertain causes', 'cause analysis', 'cause analysis seeks']"
SWOT Analysis," SWOT Analysis identifies four characteristics of a given situation strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The technique is commonly used in strategic decision making. It can be adapted for risk identification by changing the interpretation of the four perspectives, such that strengths and weaknesses relate to the characteristics of the organization conducting the project, and opportunities and threats identify the project risks. The technique is particularly useful for identifying internally-generated risks arising from within the organization. For example opportunities might be found by leveraging organizational strengths, or threats might arise as a result of organizational weaknesses, as illustrated below. 85D Figure D9. Example of a SWOT Analysis Structure",swot analysis identifies four characteristics given situation strengths weaknesses opportunities threats. technique commonly used strategic decision making. adapted risk identification changing interpretation four perspectives strengths weaknesses relate characteristics organization conducting project opportunities threats identify project risks. technique particularly useful identifying internally-generated risks arising within organization. example opportunities might found leveraging organizational strengths threats might arise result organizational weaknesses illustrated below. 85d figure d9. example swot analysis structure,['https://i.ibb.co/vqvPXVM/page-97-png-roi-0-0-99.jpg'],"['swot analysis identifies four characteristic given situation strength weakness opportunity threat', 'technique commonly used strategic decision making', 'adapted risk identification changing interpretation four perspective strength weakness relate characteristic organization conducting project opportunity threat identify project risk', 'technique particularly useful identifying internally-generated risk arising within organization', 'example opportunity might found leveraging organizational strength threat might arise result organizational weakness illustrated below', '85d figure d9. example swot analysis structure']","['example swot analysis structure', 'swot analysis', 'opportunities threats identify', 'opportunities threats identify project', 'example swot analysis', 'threats identify project risks', 'swot analysis identifies', 'swot analysis identifies characteristics', 'swot analysis structure', 'project opportunities threats identify']","['example swot analysis structure', 'swot analysis', 'example swot analysis', 'swot analysis identifies', 'swot analysis identifies characteristics', 'swot analysis structure']","['opportunities threats identify', 'opportunities threats identify project', 'threats identify project risks', 'project opportunities threats identify']"
System Dynamics," System dynamics SD is a particular application of influence diagrams see above, and can be used to identify risks within a project situation. The SD model represents entities and information ows within a project, and analysis of the model can reveal feed-back and feed-forward loops which lead to uncertainty or instability. In addition, the results of an SD analysis can show the impact of risk events on overall project results, such as the cost or schedule results to be expected. Analyses of changes in the model or assumptions can indicate the systems sensitivity to specific events, some of which may be risks. A simple example of an SD diagram is shown in Figure D11.

Estimating Techniques Applied to Probability and Impact," The probability of a risk occurring can be specified in several different ways. One common way is to assign levels of risk probability by ranges of probability. One benefit of this approach is that the subject matter experts only need to assess a risks probability within a range rather than as a specific value. An example, assuming that a 55 Probability and Impact Matrix is desired, is shown in Figure D11 where the probability ranges are more tightly defined at low levels of probability. Examples of impact level definitions are very project-specific. The values used to specify the level of impact from very low to very high if a 55 matrix is being used should be Higher impact, for threats or opportunities, as they move from very low to very high for a specific objective Levels are defined by the organization as causing the same amount of pain or gain to the project for each level across objectives If a risks possible impact is uncertain and could be assigned to more than one level of impact e.g. from moderate to high the analyst may choose to assign the risk to the impact level that represents the expected or average impact. Alternatively, the risk may be agged for extra analysis in order to reduce the range of uncertainty to fit within a single range. An example of impact level definitions is shown in Figure D11. These definitions should be tailored or scaled by stakeholders to the specific project. The definitions, appropriately tailored to the project, can be used for opportunities and threats. Table D3. Techniques for Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis continued89D Figure D11. Example of Definitions for Levels of Probability and Impact on Four Specific Objectives Used to Evaluate Individual Risks. NoteOpportunities are to be treated as representing a positive saving in time or cost, or increased functionality. For threats, each impact scale is interpreted negatively, i.e. time delays, increased cost, or reduced functionality.",probability risk occurring specified several different ways. one common way assign levels risk probability ranges probability. one benefit approach subject matter experts need assess risks probability within range rather specific value. example assuming 55 probability impact matrix desired shown figure d11 probability ranges tightly defined low levels probability. examples impact level definitions project-specific. values used specify level impact low high 55 matrix used higher impact threats opportunities move low high specific objective levels defined organization causing amount pain gain project level across objectives risks possible impact uncertain could assigned one level impact example. moderate high analyst may choose assign risk impact level represents expected average impact. alternatively risk may agged extra analysis order reduce range uncertainty fit within single range. example impact level definitions shown figure d11. definitions tailored scaled stakeholders specific project. definitions appropriately tailored project used opportunities threats. table d3. techniques perform qualitative risk analysis continued89d figure d11. example definitions levels probability impact four specific objectives used evaluate individual risks. noteopportunities treated representing positive saving time cost increased functionality. threats impact scale interpreted negatively i.e. time delays increased cost reduced functionality.,['https://i.ibb.co/D5YSp7V/page-99-png-roi-0-0-97.jpg'],"['probability risk occurring specified several different way', 'one common way assign level risk probability range probability', 'one benefit approach subject matter expert need ass risk probability within range rather specific value', 'example assuming 55 probability impact matrix desired shown figure d11 probability range tightly defined low level probability', 'example impact level definition project-specific', 'value used specify level impact low high 55 matrix used higher impact threat opportunity move low high specific objective level defined organization causing amount pain gain project level across objective risk possible impact uncertain could assigned one level impact example', 'moderate high analyst may choose assign risk impact level represents expected average impact', 'alternatively risk may agged extra analysis order reduce range uncertainty fit within single range', 'example impact level definition shown figure d11. definition tailored scaled stakeholder specific project', 'definition appropriately tailored project used opportunity threat', 'table d3. technique perform qualitative risk analysis continued89d figure d11. example definition level probability impact four specific objective used evaluate individual risk', 'noteopportunities treated representing positive saving time cost increased functionality', 'threat impact scale interpreted negatively i', 'e', 'time delay increased cost reduced functionality']","['risks possible impact uncertain', 'perform qualitative risk analysis', 'assign levels risk', 'project level objectives risks', 'assign risk impact', 'risk impact level represents', 'assign risk impact level', 'perform qualitative risk', 'objectives risks possible impact', 'risk impact level']",[],"['risks possible impact uncertain', 'perform qualitative risk analysis', 'assign levels risk', 'project level objectives risks', 'assign risk impact', 'risk impact level represents', 'assign risk impact level', 'perform qualitative risk', 'objectives risks possible impact', 'risk impact level']"
Probability and Impact Matrix," Organizations typically assess a risks priority on an objective from the combination of probability of occurrence and impact on that project objective, using definitions such as those shown in Figure D11. Risks are then placed on a probability and impact P-I matrix, such as one shown below. This matrix includes both threats and opportunities. Figure D12.

Analytic Hierarchy Process AHP," AHP is a method to calibrate preferences for achieving the different objectives of a project. Do they prefer to achieve time more than cost Is quality more important than scope What is the relative weighting of the projects objectives in terms of their priority to the stakeholders or to management The results are weights summing to 100 that re ect the relative priority of each objective. This prioritization can be important in determining how trade-offs affecting different objectives e.g., Should we reduce scope to finish on time will be decided. It can also be used to create an overall project risk priority list from risks that have been assessed on their implications for individual objectives. Specialized software implementing AHP is available. A spreadsheet implementation is shown below. Figure D13.

Decision Tree Analysis," Decision tree analysis is usually performed using specialized, but widely available software. The software allows the user to specify the structure of the decision with decision nodes, chance nodes, costs, benefits, and probabilities. The user can also evaluate the different decisions using linear utility functions based on Expected Monetary Value or on non-linear utility functions of various shapes. An example is shown below where The negative numbers represent out ows or investments e.g. COTS The percentages represent probabilities of the event occurring e.g., Major Problems The positive numbers represent rewards or values e.g., after Fix the Problem True indicates the decision option taken from the square decision node, whereas false indicates the decision option not taken Figure D14.

Expected Monetary Value," Expected Monetary Value EMV is a simple calculation of a value such as weighted average or expected cost or benefit when the outcomes are uncertain. All reasonable alternative outcomes are identified. Their probabilities of occurring summing to 100 and their values are estimated.

Monte Carlo Simulation," Monte Carlo simulation is a detailed, computer-intensive simulation approach to determining the value and probability of possible outcomes of a project objective such as a project schedule e.g., the completion date or cost estimate e.g., the total cost. It computes the schedule or cost estimate many times using inputs drawn at 95D random from ranges specified with probability distribution functions for schedule activity durations or cost line- items. The solutions using these different input values are used to build a histogram of possible project outcomes and their relative probability, and cumulative probability from which to compute desired contingency reserves of time or cost. Additional results include the relative importance of each input in determining the overall project cost and schedule. Examples of the output of schedule and cost risk results are shown in Figures D16 and D17.",monte carlo simulation detailed computer-intensive simulation approach determining value probability possible outcomes project objective project schedule example. completion date cost estimate example. total cost. computes schedule cost estimate many times using inputs drawn 95d random ranges specified probability distribution functions schedule activity durations cost line- items. solutions using different input values used build histogram possible project outcomes relative probability cumulative probability compute desired contingency reserves time cost. additional results include relative importance input determining overall project cost schedule. examples output schedule cost risk results shown figures d16 d17.,['https://i.ibb.co/M9S9xPm/page-107-png-roi-0-0-99.jpg'],"['monte carlo simulation detailed computer-intensive simulation approach determining value probability possible outcome project objective project schedule example', 'completion date cost estimate example', 'total cost', 'computes schedule cost estimate many time using input drawn 95d random range specified probability distribution function schedule activity duration cost line- item', 'solution using different input value used build histogram possible project outcome relative probability cumulative probability compute desired contingency reserve time cost', 'additional result include relative importance input determining overall project cost schedule', 'example output schedule cost risk result shown figure d16 d17.']","['project cost schedule', 'computes schedule cost estimate', 'schedule cost risk results', 'project cost schedule examples', 'schedule cost estimate', 'overall project cost schedule', 'project outcomes relative probability', 'determining overall project cost', 'schedule cost estimate times', 'schedule cost risk']",[],"['project cost schedule', 'computes schedule cost estimate', 'schedule cost risk results', 'project cost schedule examples', 'schedule cost estimate', 'overall project cost schedule', 'project outcomes relative probability', 'determining overall project cost', 'schedule cost estimate times', 'schedule cost risk']"

Contingency Reserve Estimation," All of the conditional response plans, as well any of the residual risks will, if they occur, have an effect on the schedule andor budget andor performance objectives of the project. An amount time and cost needs to be set aside to allow for these eventualities. This amount is made up of two components those to cover specific, approved conditional responses e.g. contingency plans, and those to address unspecified or passively accepted risks. Quantitative methods see chapter 7 can be used to determine the amounts that should be set aside e.g. decision trees for conditional responses, simulation for the set of unspecified risks. These reserves are tracked and managed in Monitor and Control Risks chapter 9.

Reserve Analysis," An analytical technique to determine the essential features and relationships of components in the project management plan to establish a reserve for the schedule duration, budget, estimated cost, or funds for a project. Tracking the state of the reserve through project execution will provide summary information as to the evolution of the status of the corresponding risks. This information can be useful when reporting up the organization to those responsible for several projects. In addition, once a corresponding risk occurs or ceases to be current i.e. when it can no longer impact the project, the corresponding reserve needs to be reviewed in order to assess whether it still provides the agreed level of confidence. Time buffers can be used in two different ways To provide for accepted schedule risks, as described above or As a scheduling-related technique in critical chain project management CCPM. In contrast with the contingency reserve for identified risks, the buffers in CCPM provide a shared mechanism for accommodating the natural variability of activity durations over a sequence or chain of activities. Tracking the rate at which each such buffer is used during project execution provides valuable information at a given point in time as to the level of schedule risk along that chain, and is used in CCPM for adapting the priority or management focus for additional analysis and as necessary triggering further risk management activities. No templates or examples are presented. 104D",analytical technique determine essential features relationships components project management plan establish reserve schedule duration budget estimated cost funds project. tracking state reserve project execution provide summary information evolution status corresponding risks. information useful reporting organization responsible several projects. addition corresponding risk occurs ceases current i.e. longer impact project corresponding reserve needs reviewed order assess whether still provides agreed level confidence. time buffers used two different ways provide accepted schedule risks described scheduling-related technique critical chain project management ccpm. contrast contingency reserve identified risks buffers ccpm provide shared mechanism accommodating natural variability activity durations sequence chain activities. tracking rate buffer used project execution provides valuable information given point time level schedule risk along chain used ccpm adapting priority management focus additional analysis necessary triggering risk management activities. templates examples presented. 104d,[],"['analytical technique determine essential feature relationship component project management plan establish reserve schedule duration budget estimated cost fund project', 'tracking state reserve project execution provide summary information evolution status corresponding risk', 'information useful reporting organization responsible several project', 'addition corresponding risk occurs cease current i', 'e', 'longer impact project corresponding reserve need reviewed order ass whether still provides agreed level confidence', 'time buffer used two different way provide accepted schedule risk described scheduling-related technique critical chain project management ccpm', 'contrast contingency reserve identified risk buffer ccpm provide shared mechanism accommodating natural variability activity duration sequence chain activity', 'tracking rate buffer used project execution provides valuable information given point time level schedule risk along chain used ccpm adapting priority management focus additional analysis necessary triggering risk management activity', 'template example presented']","['schedule risk chain used', 'project management ccpm', 'projects addition corresponding risk', 'schedule risks described scheduling', 'critical chain project management', 'schedule risks described', 'schedule risk chain', 'risks described scheduling related', 'chain project management ccpm', 'chain project management']",[],"['schedule risk chain used', 'project management ccpm', 'projects addition corresponding risk', 'schedule risks described scheduling', 'critical chain project management', 'schedule risks described', 'schedule risk chain', 'risks described scheduling related', 'chain project management ccpm', 'chain project management']"

GLOSSARY,"Assumptions. Assumptions are factors that, for planning purposes, are considered to be true, real, or certain without proof or demonstration. Assumptions affect all aspects of project planning and are part of the progressive elaboration of the project. Project teams frequently identify, document, and validate assumptions as part of their planning process. Assumptions generally involve a degree of risk. Benefit. Positive effect on a project objective arising from the occurrence of an opportunity. Bias. During information gathering about risk, the source of information exhibits a preference or an inclination that inhibits impartial judgment. Types of bias which commonly affect the risk process include cognitive and motivational bias. Cause. Events or circumstances which currently exist and which might give rise to risks. Consequence. See impact . Constraint. The state, quality, or sense of being restricted to a given course of action or inaction. An applicable restriction or limitation, either internal or external to a project, which will affect the performance of the project or a process. Contingency Reserve. The amount of funds, budget, or time needed above the estimate to reduce the risk of overruns of project objectives to a level acceptable to the organization. Contingency Plan. A plan developed in anticipation of the occurrence of a risk, to be executed only if specific, predetermined trigger conditions arise. Decision Tree Analysis. The decision tree is a diagram that describes a decision under consideration and the implications of choosing one or another of the available alternatives. It is used when some future scenarios or outcomes of actions are uncertain. It incorporates probabilities and the cost or rewards of each logical path of events and future decisions, and uses expected monetary value analysis to help the organization identify the relative values of alternative actions. Effect. Conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project objectives if the associated risk happened. Emergent Risk. A risk which arises later in a project and which could not have been identified earlier on. Identify Risks. The process of determining which risks may affect the project and documenting their characteristics. Impact. A measure of the effect of a risk on one or more objectives if it occurs. Also known as consequence . 110 Individual Risk. A specific uncertain event or condition which, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on at least one project objective. Issue. See problem . Likelihood. See probability . Monitor and Control Risks. The process of implementing risk response plans, tracking identified risks, monitoring residual risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating the risk process throughout the project life cycle. Monte Carlo Analysis. A technique that computes or iterates the project cost or project schedule many times using input values, selected at random from probability distributions of possible costs or durations, to calculate a distribution of possible total project cost or completion dates. Objective. Something toward which work is to be directed, a strategic position to be attained or a purpose to be achieved, a result to be obtained, a product to be produced, or a service to be performed. Opportunity. A condition or situation favorable to the project, a positive set of circumstances, a positive set of events, a risk that will have a positive impact on project objectives, or a possibility for positive changes. Contrast with threat . Overall Project Risk. Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall project risk is more than the sum of individual risks on a project, since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual elements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome measured in terms of the corresponding objectives. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis. The process of prioritizing risks for further analysis or action by assessing and combining their probability of occurrence and impact. Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis. The process of numerically analyzing the effect of identified risks on overall project objectives. Plan Risk Management. The process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project. Plan Risk Responses. The process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and to reduce threats to project objectives. Probability. A measure of how likely an individual risk is to occur. Also known as likelihood . Problem. Negative effect on a project objective arising from occurrence of a threat. Project Risk Management. Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting risk management planning, identification, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project. The purpose of Project Risk Management is to increase the probability and impact of positive events and decrease the probability and impact of events adverse to project objectives. 111 Response Strategy. A high-level approach to address an individual risk or overall project risk, broken down into a set of risk actions. Risk. An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a projects objectives. Risk Action. A detailed task which implements in whole or in part a response strategy in order to address an individual risk or overall project risk. Risk Action Owner. The person responsible for carrying out the approved risk actions for responding to a given risk. Also known as response owner when the context allows it. Risk Attitude. A chosen mental disposition towards uncertainty, adopted explicitly or implicitly by individuals and groups, driven by perception, and evidenced by observable behavior. Risk attitude exists on a continuous spectrum, but common risk attitudes include risk averse, risk tolerant, risk neutral and risk seeking. Risk Breakdown Structure RBS Tool A hierarchically organized depiction of the identified project risks arranged by risk category and subcategory that identifies the various areas and causes of potential risks. The risk breakdown structure is often tailored to specific project types. Risk Category. A group of potential causes of risk. Risk causes may be grouped into categories such as technical, external, organizational, environmental, or project management. A category may include subcategories such as technical maturity, weather, or aggressive estimating. See also Risk Breakdown Structure RBS Risk Exposure. A measure of overall project risk describing the overall effect of identified risks on objectives. Risk Management Plan. The document describing how Project Risk Management will be structured and performed on the project. It is contained in or is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan. The risk management plan can be informal and broadly framed, or formal and highly detailed, based on the needs of the project. Information in the risk management plan varies by application area and project size. The risk management plan is different from the risk register that contains the list of project risks, the results of risk analysis, and the risk responses. Risk Metalanguage. A structured description of a risk which separates cause, risk, and effect. A typical risk description using risk metalanguage might be in the form Because of cause, risk might occur, which would lead to effect. Risk Model. A representation of the project including data about project elements and risks that can be analyzed by quantitative methods. Risk Owner . The person responsible for ensuring that an appropriate response strategy is selected and implemented, and for determining suitable risk actions to implement the chosen strategy, with each risk action assigned to a single risk action owner.",assumptions. assumptions factors planning purposes considered true real certain without proof demonstration. assumptions affect aspects project planning part
