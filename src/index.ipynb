      " Project Management Institute (PMI) practice standards are guides to the use of a tool, technique, or process \n",
      "identiﬁ  ed in  A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge   ( PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition) or \n",
      "other PMI standards. Practice standards are targeted at audiences who participate in the management of \n",
      "projects. This includes project managers, project personnel, contract personnel, supervisors, and other project stakeholders. \n",
      " A PMI practice standard describes processes, activities, inputs, and outputs for a speciﬁ  c Knowledge Area. \n",
      "It provides information on what the signiﬁ  cant process, tool, or technique is, what it does, why it is signiﬁ  cant, \n",
      "when it should be performed or executed, and, if necessary for further clariﬁ  cation, who should perform the process. A practice standard does not prescribe how the process is to be implemented, leaving that subject for other forums such as handbooks, manuals, and courses. \n",
      " This chapter includes the following sections: \n",

      " 1.1 Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management \n",
      " The purpose of the  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management   is to ( a  ) provide a standard for project \n",
      "management practitioners and other stakeholders that deﬁ  nes the aspects of Project Risk Management that \n",
      "are recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and ( b  ) provide a standard that is globally \n",
      "applicable and consistently applied. This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes. \n",
      " The  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management  covers risk management as it is applied to single \n",
      "projects only. Like the  PMBOK   \n",
      "®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs \n",
      "or portfolios of projects. \n",
      " Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition, is the basis for the  Practice Standard for Project Risk \n",
      "Management . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. \n",
      " Figure 1-1 compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the  PMBOK   \n",

      " This practice standard is organized in three main sections: \n",
      " 1.  Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to \n",
      "Project Risk Management processes as deﬁ  ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition. \n",
      " 2.  Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth \n",
      "Edition. The six processes are as follows: \n",
      " Plan Risk Management, • \n",
      " Identify Risks, • \n",
      " Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, • \n",
      " Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, • \n",
      " Plan Risk Responses, and • \n",
      " Monitor and Control Risks. • \n",
      " Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: \n",
      "( a  ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b  ) critical success factors for the process; ( c   ) tools and \n",
      "techniques for the process; and ( d    ) documenting the results of the process. \n",
      " 3. A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. \n",
      " This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, \n",
      "and successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for \n",
      "several reasons: \n",
      " 1.  Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and \n",
      "techniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. \n",
      " 2.  Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk \n",
      "Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to \n",
      "apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is \n",
      "tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There \n",
      "are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. \n",
      " 3.  The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, reﬂ  ecting the many \n",
      "business and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures \n",
      "between commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. \n",
      " The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization’s processes. Practitioners can \n",
      "establish processes speciﬁ  c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice. \n",

      " 1.2 Project Risk Management Deﬁ  nition \n",
      " The deﬁ  nition of Project Risk Management, as deﬁ  ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, is the basis \n",
      "for this practice standard: “Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting \n",
      "risk management planning, identiﬁ  cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project.” The  PMBOK   \n",
      "®  Guide –  Fourth Edition also states: “The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the \n",
      "probability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the \n",
      "project.” In the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, “project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, \n",
      "has a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives.” Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, and quality. \n",
      " Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide \n",
      "action-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may \n",
      "or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as their impact on objectives. \n",
      " 1.3 Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management \n",
      " Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management. \n",
      "It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In \n",
      "this way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every process group. \n",
      " Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to ﬁ  nal design \n",
      "and from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often \n",
      "assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of project risks. \n",
      " Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it \n",
      "builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates \n",
      "and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. \n",
      " Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, \n",
      "Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of conﬁ  dence for meeting project objectives. \n",

      "Page 17 Text:\n",
      "5©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\n",
      " There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of \n",
      "risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not \n",
      "mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different \n",
      "ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the \n",
      "more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. \n",
      " A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project’s life cycle. The earlier in the project life \n",
      "cycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk \n",
      "management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project ﬂ  exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. \n",
      " It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in \n",
      "place, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. \n",
      "During project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. \n",
      " Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to \n",
      "contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice. \n",
      " 1.4 Good Risk Management Practice \n",
      " Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of \n",
      "the other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be \n",
      "conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the \n",
      "multi-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. \n",
      " Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may \n",
      "require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets, make commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements. \n",
      "\n",
      "Page 18 Text:\n",
      "6©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\n",
      " Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project \n",
      "Management code of ethics or conduct. Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing \n",
      "with others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk \n",
      "Management beneﬁ  ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement \n",
      "among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identiﬁ  cation, analysis, and response, in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable inﬂ  uences. \n",
      " Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of \n",
      "tools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the \n",
      "characteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted \n",
      "in the background with a ﬂ  exible deadline. \n",
      " Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under \n",
      "management during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions made in that process remain appropriate. \n",

      " Speciﬁ  c criteria for success of each Project Risk Management process are listed in the chapters dealing \n",
      "with those processes. The general criteria for success include: \n",
      "   • Recognize the Value of Risk Management    — Project Risk Management should be recognized \n",
      "as a valuable discipline that provides a positive potential return on investment for organizational management, project stakeholders (both internal and external), project management, and team members. \n",
      "   • Individual Commitment/Responsibility    — Project participants and stakeholders should all accept \n",
      "responsibility for undertaking risk-related activities as required. Risk management is everybody’s responsibility. \n",
      "   • Open and Honest Communication    — Everyone should be involved in the Project Risk Management \n",
      "process.  Any actions or attitudes that hinder communication about project risk reduce the effectiveness of Project Risk Management in terms of proactive approaches and effective decision-making. \n",
      "   • Organizational Commitment    — Organizational commitment can only be established if risk \n",
      "management is aligned with the organization’s goals and values. Project Risk Management may require a higher level of managerial support than other project management disciplines because handling some of the risks will require approval of or responses from others at levels above the project manager. \n",
      "   • Risk Effort Scaled to Project    — Project Risk Management activities should be consistent with the value \n",
      "of the project to the organization and with its level of project risk, its scale, and other organizational constraints. In particular, the cost of Project Risk Management should be appropriate to its potential value to the project and the organization. \n",
      "   • Integration with Project Management    — Project Risk Management does not exist in a vacuum, \n",
      "isolated from other project management processes. Successful Project Risk Management requires the correct execution of the other project management processes. \n",
      " These critical success factors for Project Risk Management are illustrated in Figure 1-2. \n",
      " 1.6 Conclusion \n",
      " The principles of Project Risk Management described in this practice standard should be appropriately \n",
      "applied based on the speciﬁ  cs of a project and the organizational environment. Project Risk Management \n",
      "provides beneﬁ  ts when it is implemented according to good practice principles and with organizational commitment to taking the decisions and performing actions in an open and unbiased manner.  \n",

      " PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS \n",
      " 2.1 Introduction \n",
      " This chapter introduces the key ideas required to understand and apply Project Risk Management to projects \n",
      "following the approach described in Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition. These principles and \n",
      "concepts are generally consistent with other approaches to Project Risk Management commonly used although \n",
      "the terminology may differ in some details. \n",
      " The execution of the Project Risk Management process is dealt with in subsequent chapters of this practice \n",
      "standard and so is not discussed here. \n",
      " 2.2 Deﬁ  nition of Project Risk \n",
      " The word “risk” is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use \n",
      "in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process \n",
      "descriptions. The deﬁ  nition of project risk given in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition is as follows: \n",
      "  Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative effect on a project’s objectives. \n",
      " This deﬁ  nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project’s objectives. When \n",
      "assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty \n",
      "dimension may be described using the term “probability” and the effect may be called “impact” (though other \n",
      "descriptors are possible, such as “likelihood” and “consequence”). \n",
      " The deﬁ  nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and \n",
      "more general conditions which are less speciﬁ  c but also may give risk to uncertainty.   The deﬁ  nition of project \n",
      "risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a project’s objectives, as \n",
      "well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uniﬁ  ed Project Risk Management process. This allows for the gain of synergies and efﬁ  ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other. \n",
      "\n",
      "Page 22 Text:\n",
      "10©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management2 CHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS\n",
      " Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they \n",
      "did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are \n",
      "events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise \n",
      "to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project \n",
      "objectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section 5.3). \n",
      " When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or \n",
      "problems; opportunities which occur may be called beneﬁ  ts. Both issues/problems and beneﬁ  ts entail project \n",
      "management actions that are outside the scope of the Project Risk Management process. \n",
      " 2.3 Individual Risks and Overall Project Risk \n",
      " It is useful to consider project risk at two levels: individual risks and overall project risk. \n",
      " Individual risks are speciﬁ  c events or conditions that might affect project objectives. An individual risk \n",
      "may positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives, elements, or tasks. Understanding \n",
      "individual risks can assist in determining how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project \n",
      "success. Day-to-day Project Risk Management focuses on these individual risks in order to enhance the \n",
      "prospects of a successful project outcome. \n",
      " Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall project risk is \n",
      "more than the sum of individual risks on a project, since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual elements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome. It is an important component of strategic decision-making, program and portfolio management, and project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set. At these higher levels, it is necessary to set realistic targets for the cost and duration of a project, establish the contingency \n",
      "reserve levels required to protect the project stakeholders, set appropriate project priorities, and judge whether the risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances. \n",
      " 2.4 Stakeholder Risk Attitudes \n",
      " The risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall \n",
      "project risk matters. A wide range of factors inﬂ  uence risk attitude. These include the scale of the project \n",
      "within the range of stakeholders’ overall activities, the strength of public commitments made about the performance of the project, and the stakeholders’ sensitivity to issues such as environmental impacts, industrial relations, and other factors. Stakeholder risk attitudes usually result in a desire for increased \n",
      "certainty in project outcomes, and may express a preference for one project objective over another. How risk is regarded is usually also strongly inﬂ  uenced by an organization’s culture. Different organizations are more or less open, and this often impacts the way risk management can be applied. \n",
      "\n",
      "Page 23 Text:\n",
      "11©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management2 CHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS\n",
      " Understanding stakeholders’ attitudes toward risk is an important component of risk management planning \n",
      "that precedes risk identiﬁ  cation and analysis, in order to optimize both project success and stakeholder \n",
      "satisfaction with the project’s results. These attitudes should be identiﬁ  ed and managed proactively and \n",
      "deliberately throughout the Project Risk Management process. They may differ from one project to another \n",
      "for the same stakeholders and will usually differ from one group of stakeholders to another. In fact a single stakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes at various stages in the same project. \n",
      " It is also important to understand the particular implications of stakeholder risk attitudes on projects where \n",
      "the team is international, cross-industry, or multi-organizational. \n",
      " 2.5 Iterative Process \n",
      " It is the nature of projects that circumstances change as they are being planned and executed. The amount \n",
      "of information available about risks will usually increase as time goes on. Some risks will occur while others will \n",
      "not, new risks will arise or be discovered, and the characteristics of those already identiﬁ  ed may change. As a result, the Project Risk Management processes should be repeated and the corresponding plans progressively elaborated throughout the lifetime of the project. \n",
      " To ensure that Project Risk Management remains effective, the identiﬁ  cation and analysis of risks should \n",
      "be revisited periodically, the progress on risk response actions should be monitored, and the action plans \n",
      "adjusted accordingly. If external circumstances change signiﬁ  cantly, it may also be necessary to revisit the risk management planning process. \n",
      " The development of an initial risk management plan and risk assessment is the start of the process, not \n",
      "the end. The frequency and depth of reviews and updates will depend on the nature of the project, the volatility of the environment in which the project is being implemented, and the timing of other project management \n",
      "reviews and updates. \n",
      " 2.6 Communication \n",
      " Project Risk Management cannot take place in isolation. Success relies heavily on communication \n",
      "throughout the process. \n",
      " Risk identiﬁ  cation and analysis depend on comprehensive input from stakeholders in a project to ensure \n",
      "that nothing signiﬁ  cant is overlooked and that risks are realistically assessed. The credibility of the process \n",
      "and the commitment of those who should act to manage risks can be assured only if the way the process \n",
      "operates and the conclusions it produces are understood and seen as credible by all concerned.

      " All projects are uncertain. Uncertainty is inevitable since projects are unique and temporary undertakings \n",
      "based on assumptions and constraints, delivering project results to multiple stakeholders with different \n",
      "requirements. Project management can be seen as an attempt to control this uncertain environment, through the use of structured and disciplined techniques such as estimating, planning, cost control, task allocation, earned value analysis, monitoring and review meetings, etc. Each of these elements of project management \n",
      "has a role in deﬁ  ning or controlling the uncertainty which is inherent in all projects. \n",
      " Project Risk Management provides an approach by which uncertainty can be understood, assessed, and \n",
      "managed within projects. As such it forms an integral part of project management, and effective Project Risk Management is a critical success factor for project success. \n",
      " For project management to be fully effective, however, it is important that Project Risk Management is not \n",
      "viewed as an optional process or performed as an additional overhead task. Since many elements of project management address inherent uncertainty, the interface between structured Project Risk Management and the \n",
      "other processes of project management needs to be clear. The outputs of Project Risk Management should be taken into account within many of the project management processes. They can, for example, impact: \n",

      "processes. On a broader level, it describes the relationships among Project Risk Management, general project management, and the management processes in the rest of the organization. To provide the greatest beneﬁ  t, initial risk management planning should be carried out early in the overall planning of the project, and the corresponding risk management activities integrated into the overall project management plan. The risk management plan may subsequently need to be adapted as the needs of the project and its stakeholders become clearer or change. \n",
      " Although the Project Risk Management processes form an integral part of the overall project management \n",
      "plan, a budget in terms of resources, cost, and time for the speciﬁ  c risk management activities should be \n",
      "established in order to better track, control, and, as necessary, defend the corresponding expenditures throughout the project. The cost of treating the risks themselves should be included appropriately in the project budget, while the risk management plan should describe how this part of the project budget is evaluated, allocated, and managed. The risk management plan will deﬁ  ne the monitoring methods to ensure that the corresponding expenditures are tracked appropriately, as well as the conditions under which the approved budget for risk management can be modiﬁ  ed. \n",
      " In the same way that project management is a process of progressive elaboration, risk management \n",
      "activities need to be repeated throughout the project. The risk management plan should deﬁ  ne both the normal frequency for repeating the processes as well as speciﬁ  c or exceptional conditions under which the corresponding actions should be initiated. The corresponding risk management activities should be integrated into the project management plan. \n",

      " A risk cannot be managed unless it is ﬁ  rst identiﬁ  ed. Consequently, after risk management planning has \n",

      "knowable risks to project objectives. \n",
      " It is, however, impossible to identify all the risks at the outset of a project. Over time, the level of project \n",
      "risk exposure changes as a result of the decisions and actions taken previously in the project (internal change) \n",
      "and of externally imposed change. \n",
      " The purpose of risk identiﬁ  cation is to identify risks to the maximum extent that is practicable. The fact that \n",
      "some risks are unknowable or emergent requires the Identify Risk process to be iterative, repeating the Identify Risks process to ﬁ  nd new risks which have become knowable since the previous iteration of the process. \n",
      " When a risk is ﬁ  rst identiﬁ  ed, potential responses may also be identiﬁ  ed at the same time. These should be \n",
      "recorded during the Identify Risks process and considered for immediate action if such action is appropriate. \n",
      "Where such responses are not implemented immediately, these should be considered during the Plan Risk Responses process. \n",

      " Risk identiﬁ  cation should be performed as early as possible in the project lifecycle, recognizing the paradox \n",
      "that uncertainty is high in the initial stages of a project so there is often less information on which to base the \n",

      "  Each practice standard provides guidelines on the mechanics (e.g., nuts and bolts, basics,  \n",
      "fundamentals, step-by-step usage guide, how it operates, how to do it) of some signiﬁ  cant process \n",
      "(input, tool, technique, or output) that is relevant to a project manager. \n",
      "  A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the life-cycle phases of many projects; however, an  \n",
      "individual practice standard may be applicable to the completion of one or more phases within a \n",
      "project. \n",
      "  A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the Knowledge Areas within   A Guide to the Project \n",
      "Management Body of Knowledge   ( PMBOK  ®  Guide –Fourth Edition), although an individual practice \n",
      "standard will provide sufﬁ  cient detail and background for one or more of the inputs, tools and \n",
      "techniques, and/or outputs. Therefore, practice standards are not required to use the name of any Knowledge Area. \n",
      "  Each practice standard should include information on what the signiﬁ  cant process is and does,  \n",
      "why it is signiﬁ  cant, how to perform it, when it should be performed, and, if necessary for further \n",
      "clariﬁ  cation, who should perform it. \n",
      "  Each practice standard should include information that is accepted and applicable for most projects  \n",
      "most of the time within the project management community. Processes that are generally restricted or \n",
      "applicable to one industry, country, or companion profession (i.e., an  application area ) may be included \n",
      "as an appendix for informational purposes, rather than as part of the practice standard. With strong \n",
      "support and evidence, an application area-speciﬁ  c process may be considered as an extension practice \n",
      "standard, in the same manner as extensions to the  PMBOK  \n",
      "®  Guide –Fourth Edition are considered. \n",
      "  Each practice standard will beneﬁ  t from the inclusion of examples and templates. It is best when an  \n",
      "example or template includes a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses. A background description \n",
      "may be necessary to put this discussion in the appropriate context. The examples should be aligned with \n",
      "the relevant information in the standard or its appendix and placed in proximity to that information. \n",
      " All practice standards shall be written in the same general style and format.   \n",

      "several reasons: \n",
      " 1.  Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and \n",
      "techniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. \n",
      " 2.  Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk \n",
      "Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to \n",

      " 1.2 Project Risk Management Deﬁ  nition \n",
      " The deﬁ  nition of Project Risk Management, as deﬁ  ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, is the basis \n",
      "for this practice standard: “Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting \n",
      "risk management planning, identiﬁ  cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project.” The  PMBOK   \n",
      "®  Guide –  Fourth Edition also states: “The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the \n",
      "probability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the \n",
      "project.” In the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, “project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, \n",
      "has a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives.” Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, and quality. \n",
      " Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide \n",
      "action-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may \n",
      "or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as their impact on objectives. \n",
      " 1.3 Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management \n",
      " Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management. \n",
      "It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In \n",
      "this way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every process group. \n",
      " Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to ﬁ  nal design \n",
      "and from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often \n",
      "assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of project risks. \n",
      " Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it \n",
      "builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates \n",
      "and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. \n",
      " Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, \n",
      "Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of conﬁ  dence for meeting project objectives.  CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\n",
      " There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of \n",
      "risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not \n",
      "mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different \n",
      "ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the \n",
      "more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. \n",
      " A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project’s life cycle. The earlier in the project life \n",
      "cycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk \n",
      "management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project ﬂ  exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. \n",
      " It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in \n",
      "place, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. \n",
      "During project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. \n",
      " Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to \n",
      "contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice. \n",
      " 1.4 Good Risk Management Practice \n",
      " Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of \n",
      "the other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be \n",
      "conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the \n",
      "multi-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. \n",
      " Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may \n",
      "require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets, make commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements.  CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\n",
      " Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project \n",
      "Management code of ethics or conduct. Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing \n",
      "with others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk \n",
      "Management beneﬁ  ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement \n",
      "among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identiﬁ  cation, analysis, and response, in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable inﬂ  uences. \n",
      " Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of \n",
      "tools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the \n",
      "characteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted \n",
      "in the background with a ﬂ  exible deadline. \n",
      " Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under \n",

      " 1.5 Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management \n",
      " Figure 1-2. Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management  CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\n",
      " Speciﬁ  c criteria for success of each Project Risk Management process are listed in the chapters dealing \n",
      "with those processes. The general criteria for success include: \n",
      "   • Recognize the Value of Risk Management    — Project Risk Management should be recognized \n",
      "as a valuable discipline that provides a positive potential return on investment for organizational management, project stakeholders (both internal and external), project management, and team members. \n",
      "   • Individual Commitment/Responsibility    — Project participants and stakeholders should all accept \n",
      "responsibility for undertaking risk-related activities as required. Risk management is everybody’s responsibility. \n",
      "   • Open and Honest Communication    — Everyone should be involved in the Project Risk Management \n",
      "process.  Any actions or attitudes that hinder communication about project risk reduce the effectiveness of Project Risk Management in terms of proactive approaches and effective decision-making. \n",
      "   • Organizational Commitment    — Organizational commitment can only be established if risk \n",
      "management is aligned with the organization’s goals and values. Project Risk Management may require a higher level of managerial support than other project management disciplines because handling some of the risks will require approval of or responses from others at levels above the project manager. \n",
      "   • Risk Effort Scaled to Project    — Project Risk Management activities should be consistent with the value \n",
      "of the project to the organization and with its level of project risk, its scale, and other organizational constraints. In particular, the cost of Project Risk Management should be appropriate to its potential value to the project and the organization. \n",
      "   • Integration with Project Management    — Project Risk Management does not exist in a vacuum, \n",
      "isolated from other project management processes. Successful Project Risk Management requires the correct execution of the other project management processes. \n",
      " These critical success factors for Project Risk Management are illustrated in Figure 1-2. \n",
      " 1.6 Conclusion \n",
      " The principles of Project Risk Management described in this practice standard should be appropriately \n",
      "applied based on the speciﬁ  cs of a project and the organizational environment. Project Risk Management \n",
      "provides beneﬁ  ts when it is implemented according to good practice principles and with organizational commitment to taking the decisions and performing actions in an open and unbiased manner.  9©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management2\n",
      "  CHAPTER 2 \n",
      " PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS \n",
      " 2.1 Introduction \n",
      " This chapter introduces the key ideas required to understand and apply Project Risk Management to projects \n",
      "following the approach described in Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition. These principles and \n",
      "concepts are generally consistent with other approaches to Project Risk Management commonly used although \n",
      "the terminology may differ in some details. \n",
      " The execution of the Project Risk Management process is dealt with in subsequent chapters of this practice \n",
      "standard and so is not discussed here. \n",
      " 2.2 Deﬁ  nition of Project Risk \n",
      " The word “risk” is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use \n",
      "in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process \n",
      "descriptions. The deﬁ  nition of project risk given in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition is as follows: \n",
      "  Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative effect on a project’s objectives. \n",
      " This deﬁ  nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project’s objectives. When \n",
      "assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty \n",
      "dimension may be described using the term “probability” and the effect may be called “impact” (though other \n",
      "descriptors are possible, such as “likelihood” and “consequence”). \n",
      " The deﬁ  nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and \n",
      "more general conditions which are less speciﬁ  c but also may give risk to uncertainty.   The deﬁ  nition of project \n",
      "risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a project’s objectives, as \n",
      "well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uniﬁ  ed Project Risk Management process. This allows for the gain of synergies and efﬁ  ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other. 10©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management2 CHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS\n",
      " Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they \n",
      "did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are \n",
      "events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise \n",
      "to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project \n",
      "objectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section 5.3). \n",
      " When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or \n",
      "problems; opportunities which occur may be called beneﬁ  ts. Both issues/problems and beneﬁ  ts entail project \n",
      "management actions that are outside the scope of the Project Risk Management process. \n",
      " 2.3 Individual Risks and Overall Project Risk \n",
      " It is useful to consider project risk at two levels: individual risks and overall project risk. \n",
      " Individual risks are speciﬁ  c events or conditions that might affect project objectives. An individual risk \n",
      "may positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives, elements, or tasks. Understanding \n",
      "individual risks can assist in determining how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project \n",
      "success. Day-to-day Project Risk Management focuses on these individual risks in order to enhance the \n",
      "prospects of a successful project outcome. \n",
      " Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall project risk is \n",
      "more than the sum of individual risks on a project, since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual elements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome. It is an important component of strategic decision-making, program and portfolio management, and project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set. At these higher levels, it is necessary to set realistic targets for the cost and duration of a project, establish the contingency \n",
      "reserve levels required to protect the project stakeholders, set appropriate project priorities, and judge whether the risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances. \n",
      " 2.4 Stakeholder Risk Attitudes \n",
      " The risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall \n",
      "project risk matters. A wide range of factors inﬂ  uence risk attitude. These include the scale of the project \n",
      "within the range of stakeholders’ overall activities, the strength of public commitments made about the performance of the project, and the stakeholders’ sensitivity to issues such as environmental impacts, industrial relations, and other factors. Stakeholder risk attitudes usually result in a desire for increased \n",
      "certainty in project outcomes, and may express a preference for one project objective over another. How risk is regarded is usually also strongly inﬂ  uenced by an organization’s culture. Different organizations are more or less open, and this often impacts the way risk management can be applied. 11©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management2 CHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS\n",
      " Understanding stakeholders’ attitudes toward risk is an important component of risk management planning \n",
      "that precedes risk identiﬁ  cation and analysis, in order to optimize both project success and stakeholder \n",
      "satisfaction with the project’s results. These attitudes should be identiﬁ  ed and managed proactively and \n",
      "deliberately throughout the Project Risk Management process. They may differ from one project to another \n",
      "for the same stakeholders and will usually differ from one group of stakeholders to another. In fact a single stakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes at various stages in the same project. \n",
      " It is also important to understand the particular implications of stakeholder risk attitudes on projects where \n",
      "the team is international, cross-industry, or multi-organizational. \n",
      " 2.5 Iterative Process \n",
      " It is the nature of projects that circumstances change as they are being planned and executed. The amount \n",
      "of information available about risks will usually increase as time goes on. Some risks will occur while others will \n",
      "not, new risks will arise or be discovered, and the characteristics of those already identiﬁ  ed may change. As a result, the Project Risk Management processes should be repeated and the corresponding plans progressively elaborated throughout the lifetime of the project. \n",
      " To ensure that Project Risk Management remains effective, the identiﬁ  cation and analysis of risks should \n",
      "be revisited periodically, the progress on risk response actions should be monitored, and the action plans \n",
      "adjusted accordingly. If external circumstances change signiﬁ  cantly, it may also be necessary to revisit the risk management planning process. \n",
      " The development of an initial risk management plan and risk assessment is the start of the process, not \n",
      "the end. The frequency and depth of reviews and updates will depend on the nature of the project, the volatility of the environment in which the project is being implemented, and the timing of other project management \n",
      "reviews and updates. \n",
      " 2.6 Communication \n",
      " Project Risk Management cannot take place in isolation. Success relies heavily on communication \n",
      "throughout the process. \n",
      " Risk identiﬁ  cation and analysis depend on comprehensive input from stakeholders in a project to ensure \n",
      "that nothing signiﬁ  cant is overlooked and that risks are realistically assessed. The credibility of the process \n",
      "and the commitment of those who should act to manage risks can be assured only if the way the process \n",
      "operates and the conclusions it produces are understood and seen as credible by all concerned. This demands effective and honest communication from the Project Risk Management process to the rest of the project team and other project stakeholders. Communication of the results of the Project Risk Management process should be targeted to meet the speciﬁ  c needs of each stakeholder and should be reﬂ  ected within the overall project communications strategy with each stakeholder’s responsibility and role in risk management identiﬁ  ed and agreed-upon. 12©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management2 CHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS\n",
      " 2.7 Responsibility for Project Risk Management \n",
      " It may be considered simplistic to say “risk management is everyone’s responsibility” as previously stated. \n",
      "However it is important that management of project risk is not left to a few risk specialists. Project Risk \n",
      "Management should be included as an integral part of all other project processes. Since project risks can affect project objectives, anyone with an interest in achieving those objectives should play a role in Project Risk Management. The speciﬁ  c roles depend on the project team members’ and other stakeholders’ place within \n",
      "the project and their relation to project objectives. Roles and responsibilities for Project Risk Management should be clearly deﬁ  ned and communicated, and individuals should be held responsible and accountable for results. This includes allocating responsibility for speciﬁ  c activities within the risk process, as well as for resulting actions required to implement agreed-upon responses. Responsibility should also be allocated for ensuring that risk-related lessons are captured for future use. \n",
      " 2.8 Project Manager’s Role for Project Risk Management \n",
      " The project manager has particular responsibilities in relation to the Project Risk Management process. \n",
      "The project manager has overall responsibility for delivering a successful project which fully meets the deﬁ  ned \n",
      "objectives. The project manager is accountable for the day-to-day management of the project, including effective risk management. The role of the project manager may include: \n",
      " Encouraging senior management support for Project Risk Management activities.  \n",
      " Determining the acceptable levels of risk for the project in consultation with stakeholders.  \n",
      " Developing and approving the risk management plan.  \n",

      " INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES \n",
      " 3.1 Project Risk Management and Project Management \n",
      " All projects are uncertain. Uncertainty is inevitable since projects are unique and temporary undertakings \n",
      "based on assumptions and constraints, delivering project results to multiple stakeholders with different \n",
      "requirements. Project management can be seen as an attempt to control this uncertain environment, through the use of structured and disciplined techniques such as estimating, planning, cost control, task allocation, earned value analysis, monitoring and review meetings, etc. Each of these elements of project management \n",
      "has a role in deﬁ  ning or controlling the uncertainty which is inherent in all projects. \n",
      " Project Risk Management provides an approach by which uncertainty can be understood, assessed, and \n",
      "managed within projects. As such it forms an integral part of project management, and effective Project Risk Management is a critical success factor for project success. \n",
      " For project management to be fully effective, however, it is important that Project Risk Management is not \n",
      "viewed as an optional process or performed as an additional overhead task. Since many elements of project management address inherent uncertainty, the interface between structured Project Risk Management and the \n",
      "other processes of project management needs to be clear. The outputs of Project Risk Management should be taken into account within many of the project management processes. They can, for example, impact: \n",
      " Estimating resource requirements, cost, or duration; • \n",
      " Assessing the impact of proposed scope changes; • \n",
      " Planning or re-planning the forward strategy of the project; • \n",
      " Allocating resources to tasks; and • \n",
      " Reporting progress to stakeholders. • \n",
      " None of these actions can be performed properly without a clear view of the risk involved, as determined \n",
      "during the Project Risk Management process. In other words, project management process effectiveness is \n",
      "increased by using the information and results from Project Risk Management. \n",
      " In addition, effective Project Risk Management requires input from other project management processes. \n",
      "Outputs such as the work breakdown structure (WBS), estimates, the project schedule, assumptions list, etc. are all important prerequisites for effective Project Risk Management. 14©2009 Project Management Institute.

      " 3.2 Project Risk Management Processes \n",
      " The deﬁ  ned steps of Project Risk Management describe a structured approach for understanding and \n",
      "managing risk on a project. This chapter outlines the steps required for effective Project Risk Management. \n",
      "Each step is described in more detail in subsequent chapters. \n",
      " As previously deﬁ  ned, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or \n",
      "negative effect on a project’s objectives. From this deﬁ  nition, it is clear that risks only exist in relation to \n",
      "objectives. It is therefore essential at the start of the Project Risk Management process to clearly deﬁ  ne the objectives. It is also clear that different projects are exposed to different levels of risk, so each step in the Project Risk Management process should be scalable to meet the varying degrees of risk. Scalable elements of the process include: \n",
      " Available resources, • \n",
      " Methodology and processes used, • \n",

      "Project Risk Management process itself. Project Risk Management activities, resources, and attention should be appropriate to the project since different projects warrant different levels of risk management application. The main actions to provide the required tailoring are as follows: \n",

To provide the greatest beneﬁ  t, initial risk management planning should be carried out early in the overall planning of the project, and the corresponding risk management activities integrated into the overall project management plan. The risk management plan may subsequently need to be adapted as the needs of the project and its stakeholders become clearer or change. \n",
      " Although the Project Risk Management processes form an integral part of the overall project management \n",

      "established in order to better track, control, and, as necessary, defend the corresponding expenditures throughout the project. The cost of treating the risks themselves should be included appropriately in the project budget, while the risk management plan should describe how this part of the project budget is evaluated, allocated, and managed. The risk management plan will deﬁ  ne the monitoring methods to ensure that the corresponding expenditures are tracked appropriately, as well as the conditions under which the approved budget for risk management can be modiﬁ  ed. \n",
      " In the same way that project management is a process of progressive elaboration, risk management \n",

      " A risk cannot be managed unless it is ﬁ  rst identiﬁ  ed. Consequently, after risk management planning has \n",
      "been completed, the ﬁ  rst process in the iterative Project Risk Management process aims to identify all the \n",
      "knowable risks to project objectives. \n",
      " It is, however, impossible to identify all the risks at the outset of a project. Over time, the level of project \n",
      "risk exposure changes as a result of the decisions and actions taken previously in the project (internal change) \n",
      "and of externally imposed change. \n",
      " The purpose of risk identiﬁ  cation is to identify risks to the maximum extent that is practicable. The fact that \n",
      "some risks are unknowable or emergent requires the Identify Risk process to be iterative, repeating the Identify Risks process to ﬁ  nd new risks which have become knowable since the previous iteration of the process. \n",
      " When a risk is ﬁ  rst identiﬁ  ed, potential responses may also be identiﬁ  ed at the same time. These should be \n",
      "recorded during the Identify Risks process and considered for immediate action if such action is appropriate. \n",
      "Where such responses are not implemented immediately, these should be considered during the Plan Risk Responses process. \n",
      " 5.2 Critical Success Factors for the Identify Risks Process \n",
      " The practices described in Sections 5.2.1 through 5.2.10 will maximize the value and effectiveness of the \n",

      " 5.2.2 Iterative Identiﬁ  cation \n",
      " Since not all risks can be identiﬁ  ed at any given point in the project, it is essential that risk identiﬁ  cation is \n",

      " In addition to invoking the Identify Risks process as deﬁ  ned in the project plan, the Project Risk Management \n",

      " A wide range of creativity techniques can be used for risk identiﬁ  cation, which encourages project \n",

The outcomes or effectiveness of these techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively.

      "Monte Carlo simulation may provide more realism in the estimate of the overall project cost or schedule \n",

However it should be recognized that quantitative risk analysis is not always required or appropriate for all projects. For example, qualitative risk analysis may provide enough information for development of effective risk responses, especially for smaller projects. Therefore, during the Plan Risk Management process, the beneﬁ  ts of quantitative risk analysis should be weighed against the effort required to ensure that the \n",
      "additional insights and value justify the additional effort. \n",
      " Partial risk analyses, such as qualitative risk analysis, aim at prioritizing individual risks viewed one at a time \n",

      " Speciﬁ  c project risks are usually best understood and quantiﬁ  ed at a detailed level such as the line-item \n",

By contrast, project objectives such as achievement of the project’s budget or the schedule are speciﬁ  ed at a higher level, often at the level of the total project. An overall risk analysis, such as one that uses quantitative techniques, estimates the implication of all quantiﬁ  ed risks on project objectives.

      "of these roles. \n",
      " Management may take ownership of risks with political, organizational causes. In addition, senior \n",
      "management should approve and track associated risk-related contingency reserves. \n",
      " 8.2.3 Specify Timing of Risk Responses \n",
      " Agreed-upon responses should be integrated into the project management plan and will therefore be \n",
      "scheduled and assigned for execution. The responses that depend on uncertain conditions should also be \n",
      "monitored so as to be performed if the conditions warrant them. \n",
      " 8.2.4 Provide Resources, Budget, and Schedule for Responses \n",
      " Each response should be planned in detail in accordance with the methodology of the project and integrated \n",
      "into the project management plan. This entails estimating the resources, costs, and duration; updating the budget and schedule; obtaining approval from management; and obtaining commitment from the risk owners and risk action owners. Management’s role at this stage is vital for supporting the project manager in developing risk responses and authorizing the corresponding resources. \n",
      " 8.2.5 Address the Interaction of Risks and Responses \n",
      " Responses may be developed to address risks related either by cause and effect or by common root cause. \n",
      "Categorization of risks, for example by using tools such as the risk breakdown structure, afﬁ  nity diagram, or other categorizing tools, may help identify and address this situation. There is also a need during the Plan Risk Responses process to consider the risks aggregated during the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process (e.g., ten small, related risks combined may pose a big risk to the project), and then to develop generic \n",
      "responses where possible. Another interaction effect that may occur is when one risk, if it occurs, may affect the probability or impact of other risks. \n",
      " Deciding on the response strategy may require a compromise, since some proposed responses may be \n",
      "mutually exclusive or counterproductive. For example mitigating a threat to time could cost money, thereby increasing pressure on the budget. Risk response planning also needs to take a holistic view of all proposed responses and make sure they are coherent. 46©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management8 CHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES\n",
      " The challenge therefore in planning responses to risks is the need to control the potential effects of the \n",
      "strategy developed for treating the original risk. If this is overlooked, the total level of threat in a project can \n",
      "actually increase, or the potential for opportunities can be compromised. \n",
      " 8.2.6 Ensure Appropriate, Timely, Effective, and Agreed-Upon Responses \n",
      " In general, responses should be appropriate, timely, cost-effective, feasible, achievable, agreed-upon, \n",
      "assigned, and accepted. Any proposed risk response plan needs to be assessed against the following criteria: \n",
      " Consistency with organizational values, project objectives, and stakeholder expectations;  \n",
      " Technical feasibility;  \n",
      "  Ability of the project team or risk action owners outside the project to carry out the corresponding  \n",
      "actions; and \n",
      "  Balance between overall impact of the response on the project objectives and the improvement in  \n",
      "the risk proﬁ  le of the project. \n",
      " 8.2.7 Address Both Threats and Opportunities \n",
      " Risk response planning should combine responses that address the threats as well as those that provide \n",
      "for opportunities into a single, integrated plan. If either threats or opportunities are not fully addressed, the \n",
      "combined set of response strategies will be incomplete and may even be invalid. \n",
      " 8.2.8 Develop Strategies before Tactical Responses \n",
      " Risk response planning should be carried out in an open-minded manner rather than adopting the ﬁ  rst \n",
      "response that seems to be feasible. The responses should be planned at a general, strategic level and the strategy validated and agreed upon, prior to developing the detailed tactical approach. \n",
      " Once the responses have been planned at a strategic level, they should be expanded into actions at the tactical \n",
      "level and integrated into the project management plan (e.g., schedule, budget, and resource assignments). This \n",
      "activity may generate additional secondary risks, which will need to be addressed at this time. \n",
      " 8.3 Risk Response Strategies \n",
      " The project manager should develop risk response strategies for individual risks, sets of risks, and project-\n",
      "level risks. An overview of the steps in arriving at a complete set of responses is given in Figure 8-2. \n",
      " The affected stakeholders should be involved in determining the strategies. Once the strategies have been \n",
      "selected, they need to be agreed upon by the entity that approves those strategies. There are four strategies \n",
      "which address individual risks for threats and opportunities as described in Sections 8.3.1 through 8.3.4 (see \n",
      "also Fig. 8-2). 47©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management8 CHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES\n",
      " 8.3.1 Avoid a Threat or Exploit an Opportunity \n",
      " This strategy involves taking the actions required to address a threat or an opportunity in order to ensure \n",
      "either that the threat cannot occur or can have no effect on the project, or that the opportunity will occur and \n",
      "the project will be able to take advantage of it. \n",
      " 8.3.2 Transfer a Threat or Share an Opportunity \n",
      " This strategy entails transference to a third party that is better positioned to address a particular threat or \n",
      "opportunity. \n",
      " 8.3.3 Mitigate a Threat or Enhance an Opportunity \n",
      " Mitigation and enhancement are the most widely applicable and widely used response strategies. Here, the \n",
      "approach is to identify actions that will decrease the probability and/or the impact of a threat, and increase the probability and/or the impact of an opportunity. \n",
      " 8.3.4 Accept a Threat or an Opportunity \n",
      " This strategy applies when the other strategies are not considered applicable or feasible. Acceptance entails \n",
      "taking no action unless the risk actually occurs, in which case contingency or fallback plans may be developed ahead of time, to be implemented if the risk presents itself. \n",
      " 8.3.5 Applying Risk Response Strategies to Overall Project Risk \n",
      " In addition to responding to individual risks, the four risk response strategies can be applied to address \n",
      "overall project risk as follows: \n",
      " Cancel the project, as a last resort, if the overall level of risk remains unacceptable.  \n",
      " Set up a business structure in which the customer and the supplier share the risk.  \n",
      "  Re-plan the project or change the scope and boundaries of the project, for example, by modifying the  \n",
      "project priority, resource allocations, delivery calendar, etc. \n",
      " Pursue the project despite a risk exposure that exceeds the desired level.  \n",
      " 8.4 Tools and Techniques for the Plan Risk Responses Process \n",
      " There are four categories of tools and techniques, as follows: \n",
      " Creativity tools to identify potential responses,  \n",
      " Decision-support tools for determining the optimal potential response.  \n",
      " Strategy implementation techniques designed to turn a strategy into action, and  \n",
      " Tools to transfer control to the Monitor and Control Risks process.  48©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management8 CHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES\n",
      " These categories of tools can be used respectively to identify potential responses, select the most \n",
      "appropriate response, translate strategy into planning, and assign the corresponding actions. The steps \n",
      "involved in planning risk responses are shown in Figure 8.2. \n",
      " 8.4.1 Response Identiﬁ  cation \n",
      " Risk response planning builds on the available information about the potential risks and aims to determine \n",
      "the optimal set of responses. For this reason, it should involve subject matter experts and employ creativity \n",
      "techniques in order to explore all of the options. Project planning and execution techniques are then required to evaluate the potential effects of the various options on the project’s objectives. \n",
      " 8.4.2 Response Selection \n",
      " Once the set of potential responses for the risks being addressed is established, decision-support techniques \n",
      "may need to be applied to select the best possible subset from these responses. The selection process should take into account the cost of the responses, the impact on the project objectives, uncertainty of outcomes and the possible secondary and residual risks. The Identify Risks, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, and Plan Risk Responses processes may then need to be applied to the resultant project management plan and the residual \n",
      "and secondary risks that it would entail. This iterative approach continues until all of the individual risks are deemed acceptable and the overall risk is within a predeﬁ  ned threshold. \n",
      " 8.4.3 Action Planning \n",
      " Project planning tools are used to turn the chosen strategies into concrete actions and to integrate these into \n",
      "existing plans. The corresponding actions may be unconditional (i.e., integrated into the project management \n",
      "plan) or contingent on a trigger condition and predeﬁ  ned as a contingency response strategy. \n",
      " 8.4.4 Ownership and Responsibility Assignment \n",
      " The project manager needs to use resource assignment processes to ensure the availability of an owner for \n",
      "each risk and for each response action, so that each associated risk is managed and each corresponding risk \n",
      "response is carried out in a timely and effective manner. \n",
      " To enable risk monitoring to identify the imminence or actual occurrence of the corresponding event, every \n",
      "contingency response strategy should include a set of trigger conditions. The responsibility for monitoring \n",
      "these conditions should be clearly assigned in the Plan Risk Responses process and managed in the Monitor and Control Risks process. 49©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management8 CHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES\n",
      " The strategic deﬁ  nition of risk responses should include measurable criteria for success of the response. \n",
      "Risk action owners should monitor their assigned risks, take agreed-upon actions as required, and provide \n",
      "the risk owners with relevant information on status or changes to the risk characteristics. Risk owners should \n",

      " For each risk or set of risks for which a contingent response has been deﬁ  ned, the corresponding set of \n",

      " Once the Plan Risk Responses process is complete, all of the approved unconditional response actions \n",
      "should have been included and deﬁ  ned in the current project management plan. The ﬁ  rst action of risk \n",
      "monitoring and controlling is to check whether this is the case and take any appropriate action if necessary, such as invoking the change management process with respect to any missing actions.

    "Project Management Institute (PMI) practice standards are guides to the use of a tool, technique, or process \n",
    "identified in  A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge   ( PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition) or \n",
    "other PMI standards. Practice standards are targeted at audiences who participate in the management of \n",
    "projects. This includes project managers, project personnel, contract personnel, supervisors, and other project stakeholders. \n",
    "A PMI practice standard describes processes, activities, inputs, and outputs for a speciﬁ  c Knowledge Area. \n",
    "It provides information on what the significant process, tool, or technique is, what it does, why it is signiﬁ  cant, \n",
    "when it should be performed or executed, and, if necessary for further clariﬁ  cation, who should perform the process. A practice standard does not prescribe how the process is to be implemented, leaving that subject for other forums such as handbooks, manuals, and courses. \n",
    " This chapter includes the following sections: \n",
    " 1.1 Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management \n",
    " 1.2 Project Risk Management Definition \n",

    " 1.1 Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management \n",
    " The purpose of the  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management   is to ( a  ) provide a standard for project \n",
    "management practitioners and other stakeholders that deﬁ  nes the aspects of Project Risk Management that \n",
    "are recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and ( b  ) provide a standard that is globally \n",
    "applicable and consistently applied. This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes. \n",
    " The  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management  covers risk management as it is applied to single \n",
    "projects only. Like the  PMBOK   \n",
    "®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs \n",
    "or portfolios of projects. \n",
    " Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition, is the basis for the  Practice Standard for Project Risk \n",
    "Management . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. \n",
    " Figure 1-1 compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the  PMBOK   \n",

    " This practice standard is organized in three main sections: \n",
    " 1.  Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to \n",
    "Project Risk Management processes as deﬁ  ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition. \n",
    " 2.  Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth \n",
    "Edition. The six processes are as follows: \n",
    " Plan Risk Management, • \n",
    " Identify Risks, • \n",
    " Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, • \n",
    " Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, • \n",
    " Plan Risk Responses, and • \n",
    " Monitor and Control Risks. • \n",
    " Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: \n",
    "( a  ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b  ) critical success factors for the process; ( c   ) tools and \n",
    "techniques for the process; and ( d    ) documenting the results of the process. \n",
    " 3. A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. \n",
    " This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, \n",
    "and successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for \n",
    "several reasons: \n",
    " 1.  Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and \n",
    "techniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. \n",
    " 2.  Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk \n",
    "Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to \n",
    "apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is \n",
    "tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There \n",
    "are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. \n",
    " 3.  The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, reﬂ  ecting the many \n",
    "business and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures \n",
    "between commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. \n",
    " The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization’s processes. Practitioners can \n",
    "establish processes speciﬁ  c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice. \n",
