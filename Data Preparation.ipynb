      " The purpose of the  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management   is to ( a  ) provide a standard for project \n",
      "management practitioners and other stakeholders that deﬁ  nes the aspects of Project Risk Management that \n",
      "are recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and ( b  ) provide a standard that is globally \n",
      "applicable and consistently applied. This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes. \n",
      " The  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management  covers risk management as it is applied to single \n",
      "projects only. Like the  PMBOK   \n",
      "®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs \n",
      "or portfolios of projects. \n",
      " Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition, is the basis for the  Practice Standard for Project Risk \n",
      "Management . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. \n",
      " Figure 1-1 compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the  PMBOK   \n",

      " This practice standard is organized in three main sections: \n",
      " 1.  Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to \n",
      "Project Risk Management processes as deﬁ  ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition. \n",
      " 2.  Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth \n",
      "Edition. The six processes are as follows: \n",
      " Plan Risk Management, • \n",
      " Identify Risks, • \n",
      " Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, • \n",
      " Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, • \n",
      " Plan Risk Responses, and • \n",
      " Monitor and Control Risks. • \n",
      " Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: \n",
      "( a  ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b  ) critical success factors for the process; ( c   ) tools and \n",
      "techniques for the process; and ( d    ) documenting the results of the process. \n",
      " 3. A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. \n",
      " This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, \n",
      "and successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for \n",
      "several reasons: \n",
      " 1.  Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and \n",
      "techniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. \n",
      " 2.  Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk \n",
      "Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to \n",
      "apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is \n",
      "tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There \n",
      "are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. \n",
      " 3.  The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, reﬂ  ecting the many \n",
      "business and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures \n",
      "between commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. \n",
      " The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization’s processes. Practitioners can \n",
      "establish processes speciﬁ  c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice. 4©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\n",
      " 1.2 Project Risk Management Deﬁ  nition \n",
      " The deﬁ  nition of Project Risk Management, as deﬁ  ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, is the basis \n",
      "for this practice standard: “Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting \n",
      "risk management planning, identiﬁ  cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project.” The  PMBOK   \n",
      "®  Guide –  Fourth Edition also states: “The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the \n",
      "probability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the \n",
      "project.” In the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, “project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, \n",
      "has a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives.” Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, and quality. \n",
      " Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide \n",
      "action-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may \n",
      "or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as their impact on objectives. \n",
      " 1.3 Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management \n",
      " Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management. \n",
      "It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In \n",
      "this way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every process group. \n",
      " Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to ﬁ  nal design \n",
      "and from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often \n",
      "assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of project risks. \n",
      " Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it \n",
      "builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates \n",
      "and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. \n",
      " Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, \n",
      "Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of conﬁ  dence for meeting project objectives. 5©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\n",
      " There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of \n",
      "risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not \n",
      "mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different \n",
      "ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the \n",
      "more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. \n",
      " A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project’s life cycle. The earlier in the project life \n",
      "cycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk \n",
      "management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project ﬂ  exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. \n",
      " It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in \n",
      "place, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. \n",
      "During project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. \n",
      " Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to \n",
      "contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice. \n",
      " 1.4 Good Risk Management Practice \n",
      " Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of \n",
      "the other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be \n",
      "conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the \n",
      "multi-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. \n",
      " Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may \n",
      "require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets, make commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements. 6©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\n",
      " Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project \n",
      "Management code of ethics or conduct. Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing \n",
      "with others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk \n",
      "Management beneﬁ  ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement \n",
      "among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identiﬁ  cation, analysis, and response, in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable inﬂ  uences. \n",
      " Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of \n",
      "tools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the \n",
      "characteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted \n",
      "in the background with a ﬂ  exible deadline. \n",
      " Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under \n",
      "management during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions made in that process remain appropriate. \n",
      " 1.5 Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management \n",
      " Figure 1-2. Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management 7©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\n",
      " Speciﬁ  c criteria for success of each Project Risk Management process are listed in the chapters dealing \n",
      "with those processes. The general criteria for success include: \n",
      "   • Recognize the Value of Risk Management    — Project Risk Management should be recognized \n",
      "as a valuable discipline that provides a positive potential return on investment for organizational management, project stakeholders (both internal and external), project management, and team members. \n",
      "   • Individual Commitment/Responsibility    — Project participants and stakeholders should all accept \n",
      "responsibility for undertaking risk-related activities as required. Risk management is everybody’s responsibility. \n",
      "   • Open and Honest Communication    — Everyone should be involved in the Project Risk Management \n",
      "process.  Any actions or attitudes that hinder communication about project risk reduce the effectiveness of Project Risk Management in terms of proactive approaches and effective decision-making. \n",
      "   • Organizational Commitment    — Organizational commitment can only be established if risk \n",
      "management is aligned with the organization’s goals and values. Project Risk Management may require a higher level of managerial support than other project management disciplines because handling some of the risks will require approval of or responses from others at levels above the project manager. \n",
      "   • Risk Effort Scaled to Project    — Project Risk Management activities should be consistent with the value \n",
      "of the project to the organization and with its level of project risk, its scale, and other organizational constraints. In particular, the cost of Project Risk Management should be appropriate to its potential value to the project and the organization. \n",
      "   • Integration with Project Management    — Project Risk Management does not exist in a vacuum, \n",
      "isolated from other project management processes. Successful Project Risk Management requires the correct execution of the other project management processes. \n",
      " These critical success factors for Project Risk Management are illustrated in Figure 1-2. \n",
      " 1.6 Conclusion \n",
      " The principles of Project Risk Management described in this practice standard should be appropriately \n",
      "applied based on the speciﬁ  cs of a project and the organizational environment. Project Risk Management \n",
      "provides beneﬁ  ts when it is implemented according to good practice principles and with organizational commitment to taking the decisions and performing actions in an open and unbiased manner.  9©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management2\n",
      "  CHAPTER 2 \n",
      " PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS \n",
      " 2.1 Introduction \n",
      " This chapter introduces the key ideas required to understand and apply Project Risk Management to projects \n",
      "following the approach described in Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition. These principles and \n",
      "concepts are generally consistent with other approaches to Project Risk Management commonly used although \n",
      "the terminology may differ in some details. \n",
      " The execution of the Project Risk Management process is dealt with in subsequent chapters of this practice \n",
      "standard and so is not discussed here. \n",
      " 2.2 Deﬁ  nition of Project Risk \n",
      " The word “risk” is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use \n",
      "in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process \n",
      "descriptions. The deﬁ  nition of project risk given in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition is as follows: \n",
      "  Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative effect on a project’s objectives. \n",
      " This deﬁ  nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project’s objectives. When \n",
      "assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty \n",
      "dimension may be described using the term “probability” and the effect may be called “impact” (though other \n",
      "descriptors are possible, such as “likelihood” and “consequence”). \n",
      " The deﬁ  nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and \n",
      "more general conditions which are less speciﬁ  c but also may give risk to uncertainty.   The deﬁ  nition of project \n",
      "risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a project’s objectives, as \n",
      "well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uniﬁ  ed Project Risk Management process. This allows for the gain of synergies and efﬁ  ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other. 10©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management2 CHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS\n",
      " Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they \n",
      "did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are \n",
      "events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise \n",
      "to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project \n",
      "objectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section 5.3). \n",
      " When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or \n",
      "problems; opportunities which occur may be called beneﬁ  ts. Both issues/problems and beneﬁ  ts entail project \n",
      "management actions that are outside the scope of the Project Risk Management process. \n",
      " 2.3 Individual Risks and Overall Project Risk \n",
      " It is useful to consider project risk at two levels: individual risks and overall project risk. \n",
      " Individual risks are speciﬁ  c events or conditions that might affect project objectives. An individual risk \n",
      "may positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives, elements, or tasks. Understanding \n",
      "individual risks can assist in determining how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project \n",
      "success. Day-to-day Project Risk Management focuses on these individual risks in order to enhance the \n",
      "prospects of a successful project outcome. \n",
      " Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall project risk is \n",
      "more than the sum of individual risks on a project, since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual elements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome. It is an important component of strategic decision-making, program and portfolio management, and project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set. At these higher levels, it is necessary to set realistic targets for the cost and duration of a project, establish the contingency \n",
      "reserve levels required to protect the project stakeholders, set appropriate project priorities, and judge whether the risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances. \n",
      " 2.4 Stakeholder Risk Attitudes \n",
      " The risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall \n",
      "project risk matters. A wide range of factors inﬂ  uence risk attitude. These include the scale of the project \n",
      "within the range of stakeholders’ overall activities, the strength of public commitments made about the performance of the project, and the stakeholders’ sensitivity to issues such as environmental impacts, industrial relations, and other factors. Stakeholder risk attitudes usually result in a desire for increased \n",
      "certainty in project outcomes, and may express a preference for one project objective over another. How risk is regarded is usually also strongly inﬂ  uenced by an organization’s culture. Different organizations are more or less open, and this often impacts the way risk management can be applied. 11©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management2 CHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS\n",
      " Understanding stakeholders’ attitudes toward risk is an important component of risk management planning \n",
      "that precedes risk identiﬁ  cation and analysis, in order to optimize both project success and stakeholder \n",
      "satisfaction with the project’s results. These attitudes should be identiﬁ  ed and managed proactively and \n",
      "deliberately throughout the Project Risk Management process. They may differ from one project to another \n",
      "for the same stakeholders and will usually differ from one group of stakeholders to another. In fact a single stakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes at various stages in the same project. \n",
      " It is also important to understand the particular implications of stakeholder risk attitudes on projects where \n",
      "the team is international, cross-industry, or multi-organizational. \n",
      " 2.5 Iterative Process \n",
      " It is the nature of projects that circumstances change as they are being planned and executed. The amount \n",
      "of information available about risks will usually increase as time goes on. Some risks will occur while others will \n",
      "not, new risks will arise or be discovered, and the characteristics of those already identiﬁ  ed may change. As a result, the Project Risk Management processes should be repeated and the corresponding plans progressively elaborated throughout the lifetime of the project. \n",
      " To ensure that Project Risk Management remains effective, the identiﬁ  cation and analysis of risks should \n",
      "be revisited periodically, the progress on risk response actions should be monitored, and the action plans \n",
      "adjusted accordingly. If external circumstances change signiﬁ  cantly, it may also be necessary to revisit the risk management planning process. \n",
      " The development of an initial risk management plan and risk assessment is the start of the process, not \n",
      "the end. The frequency and depth of reviews and updates will depend on the nature of the project, the volatility of the environment in which the project is being implemented, and the timing of other project management \n",
      "reviews and updates. \n",
      " 2.6 Communication \n",
      " Project Risk Management cannot take place in isolation. Success relies heavily on communication \n",
      "throughout the process. \n",
      " Risk identiﬁ  cation and analysis depend on comprehensive input from stakeholders in a project to ensure \n",
      "that nothing signiﬁ  cant is overlooked and that risks are realistically assessed. The credibility of the process \n",
      "and the commitment of those who should act to manage risks can be assured only if the way the process \n",
      "operates and the conclusions it produces are understood and seen as credible by all concerned. This demands effective and honest communication from the Project Risk Management process to the rest of the project team and other project stakeholders. Communication of the results of the Project Risk Management process should be targeted to meet the speciﬁ  c needs of each stakeholder and should be reﬂ  ected within the overall project communications strategy with each stakeholder’s responsibility and role in risk management identiﬁ  ed and agreed-upon. 12©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management2 CHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS\n",
      " 2.7 Responsibility for Project Risk Management \n",
      " It may be considered simplistic to say “risk management is everyone’s responsibility” as previously stated. \n",
      "However it is important that management of project risk is not left to a few risk specialists. Project Risk \n",
      "Management should be included as an integral part of all other project processes. Since project risks can affect project objectives, anyone with an interest in achieving those objectives should play a role in Project Risk Management. The speciﬁ  c roles depend on the project team members’ and other stakeholders’ place within \n",
      "the project and their relation to project objectives. Roles and responsibilities for Project Risk Management should be clearly deﬁ  ned and communicated, and individuals should be held responsible and accountable for results. This includes allocating responsibility for speciﬁ  c activities within the risk process, as well as for resulting actions required to implement agreed-upon responses. Responsibility should also be allocated for ensuring that risk-related lessons are captured for future use. \n",
      " 2.8 Project Manager’s Role for Project Risk Management \n",
      " The project manager has particular responsibilities in relation to the Project Risk Management process. \n",
      "The project manager has overall responsibility for delivering a successful project which fully meets the deﬁ  ned \n",
      "objectives. The project manager is accountable for the day-to-day management of the project, including effective risk management. The role of the project manager may include: \n",
      " Encouraging senior management support for Project Risk Management activities.  \n",
      " Determining the acceptable levels of risk for the project in consultation with stakeholders.  \n",
      " Developing and approving the risk management plan.  \n",
      " Promoting the Project Risk Management process for the project.  \n",
      "  Facilitating open and honest communication about risk within the project team and with  \n",

      " A risk cannot be managed unless it is ﬁ  rst identiﬁ  ed. Consequently, after risk management planning has \n",

      " It is, however, impossible to identify all the risks at the outset of a project. Over time, the level of project \n",

      "and of externally imposed change. \n",
      " The purpose of risk identiﬁ  cation is to identify risks to the maximum extent that is practicable. The fact that \n",
      "some risks are unknowable or emergent requires the Identify Risk process to be iterative, repeating the Identify Risks process to ﬁ  nd new risks which have become knowable since the previous iteration of the process. \n",
      " When a risk is ﬁ  rst identiﬁ  ed, potential responses may also be identiﬁ  ed at the same time. These should be \n",
      "recorded during the Identify Risks process and considered for immediate action if such action is appropriate. \n",
      "Where such responses are not implemented immediately, these should be considered during the Plan Risk Responses process. \n",

Therefore, during the Plan Risk Management process, the beneﬁ  ts of quantitative risk analysis should be weighed against the effort required to ensure that the \n",

      " Once risks have been identiﬁ  ed, analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be developed for addressing every \n",
      "risk the project team considers to be sufﬁ  ciently important, either because of the threat it poses to the project \n",
      "objectives or the opportunity it offers. The planning entails agreeing upon the actions to be taken and the \n",
      "potential changes to budget, schedule, resources, and scope which these actions might cause. \n",
      " Contingent risk response actions need to be executed at the optimum time. For this reason, the response \n",
      "speciﬁ  cation for each such risk should include a description of any corresponding trigger conditions. \n",
      " The responsibility for monitoring the project conditions and implementing the corresponding actions should \n",
      "be clearly assigned. Every risk should have been allocated to a risk owner as part of the Identify Risks process, \n",
      "and each of the corresponding risk responses should now be assigned to a speciﬁ  c risk action owner. The risk owner is responsible for ensuring that the risk response is effective and for planning additional risk responses if required, whereas the risk action owner is responsible for ensuring that the agreed-upon risk responses are carried out as planned, in a timely manner. The role of the risk owner and that of the risk action owner may be assigned to a single person. \n",
      " Responses, when implemented, can have potential effects on the project objectives and, as such, can \n",
      "generate additional risks. These are known as secondary risks and have to be analyzed and planned for in the same way as those risks which were initially identiﬁ  ed. \n",
      " It is never feasible or even desirable to eliminate all threats from a project. Similarly, there is also a limit \n",
      "to the extent to which opportunities can be proactively managed. There may be residual risks that will remain after the responses have been implemented. These residual risks should be clearly identiﬁ  ed, analyzed, \n",

      " The risk response success will be dependent upon the full support and involvement of the project team and \n",
      "other stakeholders. The key roles for Project Risk Management are those of risk owner and risk action owner. \n",
      "A single risk owner should be assigned to every identiﬁ  ed risk, and each agreed-upon risk response should have a single risk action owner. The people with the corresponding responsibilities should be aware of what is expected of them, and the other project stakeholders should understand and accept the needs and authority \n",
      "of these roles. \n",

      "monitored so as to be performed if the conditions warrant them. \n",
      " 8.2.4 Provide Resources, Budget, and Schedule for Responses \n",
      " Each response should be planned in detail in accordance with the methodology of the project and integrated \n",
      "into the project management plan. This entails estimating the resources, costs, and duration; updating the budget and schedule; obtaining approval from management; and obtaining commitment from the risk owners and risk action owners. Management’s role at this stage is vital for supporting the project manager in developing risk responses and authorizing the corresponding resources. \n",
      " 8.2.5 Address the Interaction of Risks and Responses \n",
      " Responses may be developed to address risks related either by cause and effect or by common root cause. \n",
      "Categorization of risks, for example by using tools such as the risk breakdown structure, afﬁ  nity diagram, or other categorizing tools, may help identify and address this situation. There is also a need during the Plan Risk Responses process to consider the risks aggregated during the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process (e.g., ten small, related risks combined may pose a big risk to the project), and then to develop generic \n",
      "responses where possible. Another interaction effect that may occur is when one risk, if it occurs, may affect the probability or impact of other risks. \n",
      " Deciding on the response strategy may require a compromise, since some proposed responses may be \n",
      "mutually exclusive or counterproductive. For example mitigating a threat to time could cost money, thereby increasing pressure on the budget. Risk response planning also needs to take a holistic view of all proposed responses and make sure they are coherent. 46©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management8 CHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES\n",
      " The challenge therefore in planning responses to risks is the need to control the potential effects of the \n",

      "actually increase, or the potential for opportunities can be compromised. \n",
      " 8.2.6 Ensure Appropriate, Timely, Effective, and Agreed-Upon Responses \n",
      " In general, responses should be appropriate, timely, cost-effective, feasible, achievable, agreed-upon, \n",
      "assigned, and accepted. Any proposed risk response plan needs to be assessed against the following criteria: \n",
      " Consistency with organizational values, project objectives, and stakeholder expectations;  \n",
      " Technical feasibility;  \n",
      "  Ability of the project team or risk action owners outside the project to carry out the corresponding  \n",

      "the risk proﬁ  le of the project. \n",
      " 8.2.7 Address Both Threats and Opportunities \n",
      " Risk response planning should combine responses that address the threats as well as those that provide \n",
      "for opportunities into a single, integrated plan. If either threats or opportunities are not fully addressed, the \n",
      "combined set of response strategies will be incomplete and may even be invalid. \n",
      " 8.2.8 Develop Strategies before Tactical Responses \n",
      " Risk response planning should be carried out in an open-minded manner rather than adopting the ﬁ  rst \n",

      " 8.3.1 Avoid a Threat or Exploit an Opportunity \n",
      " This strategy involves taking the actions required to address a threat or an opportunity in order to ensure \n",
      "either that the threat cannot occur or can have no effect on the project, or that the opportunity will occur and \n",
      "the project will be able to take advantage of it. \n",
      " 8.3.2 Transfer a Threat or Share an Opportunity \n",
      " This strategy entails transference to a third party that is better positioned to address a particular threat or \n",
      "opportunity. \n",
      " 8.3.3 Mitigate a Threat or Enhance an Opportunity \n",
      " Mitigation and enhancement are the most widely applicable and widely used response strategies. Here, the \n",
      "approach is to identify actions that will decrease the probability and/or the impact of a threat, and increase the probability and/or the impact of an opportunity. \n",
      " 8.3.4 Accept a Threat or an Opportunity \n",
      " This strategy applies when the other strategies are not considered applicable or feasible. Acceptance entails \n",
      "taking no action unless the risk actually occurs, in which case contingency or fallback plans may be developed ahead of time, to be implemented if the risk presents itself. \n",
      " 8.3.5 Applying Risk Response Strategies to Overall Project Risk \n",
      " In addition to responding to individual risks, the four risk response strategies can be applied to address \n",
      "overall project risk as follows: \n",
      " Cancel the project, as a last resort, if the overall level of risk remains unacceptable.  \n",
      " Set up a business structure in which the customer and the supplier share the risk.  \n",

      " 8.4 Tools and Techniques for the Plan Risk Responses Process \n",

      " 8.4.2 Response Selection \n",
      " Once the set of potential responses for the risks being addressed is established, decision-support techniques \n",
      "may need to be applied to select the best possible subset from these responses. The selection process should take into account the cost of the responses, the impact on the project objectives, uncertainty of outcomes and the possible secondary and residual risks.

      "and secondary risks that it would entail. This iterative approach continues until all of the individual risks are deemed acceptable and the overall risk is within a predeﬁ  ned threshold. \n",
      " 8.4.3 Action Planning \n",
      " Project planning tools are used to turn the chosen strategies into concrete actions and to integrate these into \n",

      " A PMI practice standard is characterized as follows: \n",
      "  Each practice standard provides guidelines on the mechanics (e.g., nuts and bolts, basics,  \n",
      "fundamentals, step-by-step usage guide, how it operates, how to do it) of some signiﬁ  cant process \n",
      "(input, tool, technique, or output) that is relevant to a project manager. \n",
      "  A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the life-cycle phases of many projects; however, an  \n",
      "individual practice standard may be applicable to the completion of one or more phases within a \n",
      "project. \n",
      "  A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the Knowledge Areas within   A Guide to the Project \n",
      "Management Body of Knowledge   ( PMBOK  ®  Guide –Fourth Edition), although an individual practice \n",
      "standard will provide sufﬁ  cient detail and background for one or more of the inputs, tools and \n",
      "techniques, and/or outputs. Therefore, practice standards are not required to use the name of any Knowledge Area. \n",
      "  Each practice standard should include information on what the signiﬁ  cant process is and does,  \n",
      "why it is signiﬁ  cant, how to perform it, when it should be performed, and, if necessary for further \n",
      "clariﬁ  cation, who should perform it. \n",
      "  Each practice standard should include information that is accepted and applicable for most projects  \n",
      "most of the time within the project management community. Processes that are generally restricted or \n",
      "applicable to one industry, country, or companion profession (i.e., an  application area ) may be included \n",
      "as an appendix for informational purposes, rather than as part of the practice standard. With strong \n",
      "support and evidence, an application area-speciﬁ  c process may be considered as an extension practice \n",
      "standard, in the same manner as extensions to the  PMBOK  \n",
      "®  Guide –Fourth Edition are considered. \n",
      "  Each practice standard will beneﬁ  t from the inclusion of examples and templates. It is best when an  \n",
      "example or template includes a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses. A background description \n",
      "may be necessary to put this discussion in the appropriate context. The examples should be aligned with \n",
      "the relevant information in the standard or its appendix and placed in proximity to that information. \n",
      " All practice standards shall be written in the same general style and format.   \n",
      " E ach practice standard project will be aligned with or reference other practice standards, as needed.  \n",
      " Each practice standard will be consistent with the   PMBOK  ®  Guide –Fourth Edition. \n",

      " B.1 Pre-Project \n",
      " In early 2005, PMI began exploration for developing the ﬁ  rst Practice Standard for Project Risk Management. \n",
      "Focus would be placed on single project risk management for a single project rather than including programs \n",
      "or portfolios of projects, with close coupling to the Project Risk Management section of  A Guide to the Project \n",

      "Members Advisory Group (MAG) approved the following ﬁ  nal charter for the standard, with Cynthia A. Berg, PMP , as the Project Manager, and Dr. David Hulett as the Deputy Project Manager. The charter included the following characteristics for the standard: \n",

      " B.2 Preliminary Work \n",

      " During the time the project was chartered, the  PMBOK  ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition was commissioned. As a \n",
      "result, the charter of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management was expanded to be consistent and non-contradictory with that standard. \n",
      " B.4 Exposure and Consensus \n",
      " The standard was submitted as an exposure draft in the winter of 2007, and exposed on 23 March 2008. \n",
      "There were 849 comments. The team’s comment acceptance rate (comments accepted outright, and accepted with modiﬁ  cations) was 57%. The PMI Standards Manager submitted the resultant ﬁ  nal draft, with the concurrence of the PMI Standards  Program MAG, to the PMI Standards Program Consensus Body for ofﬁ  cial ballot on 27 March 2009 . Twenty-eight members of the PMI Standards Program Consensus Body agreed to \n",

      "the PM and Deputy PM for this standard because their participation was considered a conﬂ  ict of interest. The balloting period was closed on 25 April 2009 with 23 ballots returned.

      " CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION 1.1 Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management  The purpose of the  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management   is to  a   provide a standard for project management practitioners and other stakeholders that defines the aspects of Project Risk Management that are recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and  b   provide a standard that is globally applicable and consistently applied. This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes.  The  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management  covers risk management as it is applied to single projects only. Like the  PMBOK     Guide   Fourth Edition this practice standard does not cover risk in programs or portfolios of projects.  Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK     Guide   Fourth Edition is the basis for the  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards.  Figure 11 compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the  PMBOK     Guide   Fourth Edition and textbooks handbooks and courses.  Figure 11. Hierarchy of PMI Project Risk Management Resources  CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION This practice standard is organized in three main sections  1.  Introductory material including the framework purpose principles context of and introduction to Project Risk Management processes as defined in the  PMBOK     Guide   Fourth Edition.  2.  Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the  PMBOK     Guide   Fourth Edition. The six processes are as follows  Plan Risk Management   Identify Risks   Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis   Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis   Plan Risk Responses and   Monitor and Control Risks.   Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics  a   purpose and objectives of the process  b   critical success factors for the process  c    tools and techniques for the process and  d     documenting the results of the process.  3. A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard.  This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective comprehensive and successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for several reasons  1.  Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and techniques are constantly evolving the principles have more stability and persistence.  2.  Different projects organizations and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk Management. In particular risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture processes and assets. There are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard.  3.  The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context re  ecting the many business and organizational arrangements between participants for example joint ventures between commercial and national companies government and nongovernment organizations and the crosscultural environment often found on these project teams.  The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organizations processes. Practitioners can establish processes specific to their particular situation project or organization and then compare them with these principles thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.  CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION 1.2 Project Risk Management Definition  The definition of Project Risk Management as defined in the  PMBOK     Guide   Fourth Edition is the basis for this practice standard Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting risk management planning identification analysis responses and monitoring and control on a project. The  PMBOK     Guide   Fourth Edition also states The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the probability and impact of positive events and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the project. In the  PMBOK     Guide   Fourth Edition project risk is an uncertain event or condition that if it occurs has a positive or negative effect on a projects objectives. Project objectives include scope schedule cost and quality.  Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence and provide actionoriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as their impact on objectives.  1.3 Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management  Project Risk Management is not an optional activity it is essential to successful project management. It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In this way it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project in every phase and in every process group.  Many of the project management processes address planning the project from concept to final design and from procurement through daily management of execution and closeout. These processes often assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and therefore they need to include treatment of project risks.  Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore it builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project.  Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes e.g. scheduling budgeting and change management be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account. For instance risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of confidence for meeting project objectives.  CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project the level of risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather there may be different ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be.  A risk management approach is applicable throughout a projects life cycle. The earlier in the project life cycle that the risks are recognized the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment such as stakeholders scope time and cost as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project   exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop.  It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions agreements and contracts in place the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. During project execution risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future.  Finally throughout the project and during project closure riskrelated lessons are reviewed in order to contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice.  1.4 Good Risk Management Practice  Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of the other project management processes. As with all of these processes Project Risk Management should be conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition like the other processes involved in project management Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the multicultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers suppliers and workforces spread around the globe.  Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel establish or modify budgets make commitments to others outside the project interact with regulators and comply with the rules of accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements.  CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis in keeping with the Project Management code of ethics or conduct. Honesty responsibility realism professionalism and fair dealing with others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk Management benefits from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general and risk identification analysis and response in particular should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable in  uences.  Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree level of detail sophistication of tools and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the characteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources time and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller shortterm internal project that can be conducted in the background with a   exible deadline.  Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under management during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions made in that process remain appropriate.  1.5 Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management  Figure 12. Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management  CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION Specific criteria for success of each Project Risk Management process are listed in the chapters dealing with those processes. The general criteria for success include     Recognize the Value of Risk Management     Project Risk Management should be recognized as a valuable discipline that provides a positive potential return on investment for organizational management project stakeholders both internal and external project management and team members.     Individual CommitmentResponsibility     Project participants and stakeholders should all accept responsibility for undertaking riskrelated activities as required. Risk management is everybodys responsibility.     Open and Honest Communication     Everyone should be involved in the Project Risk Management process.  Any actions or attitudes that hinder communication about project risk reduce the effectiveness of Project Risk Management in terms of proactive approaches and effective decisionmaking.     Organizational Commitment     Organizational commitment can only be established if risk management is aligned with the organizations goals and values. Project Risk Management may require a higher level of managerial support than other project management disciplines because handling some of the risks will require approval of or responses from others at levels above the project manager.     Risk Effort Scaled to Project     Project Risk Management activities should be consistent with the value of the project to the organization and with its level of project risk its scale and other organizational constraints. In particular the cost of Project Risk Management should be appropriate to its potential value to the project and the organization.     Integration with Project Management     Project Risk Management does not exist in a vacuum isolated from other project management processes. Successful Project Risk Management requires the correct execution of the other project management processes.  These critical success factors for Project Risk Management are illustrated in Figure 12.  1.6 Conclusion  The principles of Project Risk Management described in this practice standard should be appropriately applied based on the specifics of a project and the organizational environment. Project Risk Management provides benefits when it is implemented according to good practice principles and with organizational commitment to taking the decisions and performing actions in an open and unbiased manner.    CHAPTER 2  PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS  2.1 Introduction  This chapter introduces the key ideas required to understand and apply Project Risk Management to projects following the approach described in Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK     Guide   Fourth Edition. These principles and concepts are generally consistent with other approaches to Project Risk Management commonly used although the terminology may differ in some details.  The execution of the Project Risk Management process is dealt with in subsequent chapters of this practice standard and so is not discussed here.  2.2 Definition of Project Risk  The word risk is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use in the  PMBOK     Guide   Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process descriptions. The definition of project risk given in the  PMBOK     Guide   Fourth Edition is as follows   Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that if it occurs has a positive or a negative effect on a projects objectives.  This definition includes two key dimensions of risk uncertainty and effect on a projects objectives. When assessing the importance of a project risk these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty dimension may be described using the term probability and the effect may be called impact though other descriptors are possible such as likelihood and consequence.  The definition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described and more general conditions which are less specific but also may give risk to uncertainty.   The definition of project risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a projects objectives as well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called respectively threats and opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a unified Project Risk Management process. This allows for the gain of synergies and efficiencies such as addressing both in the same analyses and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other. 1 CHAPTER 2  PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur but which would matter if they did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from riskrelated features such as cause and effect. Causes are events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project objectives if the associated risk occurs. The causeriskeffect chain can be used in a structured risk statement or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described see Section 5.3.  When a risk event occurs it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or problems opportunities which occur may be called benefits. Both issuesproblems and benefits entail project management actions that are outside the scope of the Project Risk Management process.  2.3 Individual Risks and Overall Project Risk  It is useful to consider project risk at two levels individual risks and overall project risk.  Individual risks are specific events or conditions that might affect project objectives. An individual risk may positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives elements or tasks. Understanding individual risks can assist in determining how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project success. Daytoday Project Risk Management focuses on these individual risks in order to enhance the prospects of a successful project outcome.  Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall project risk is more than the sum of individual risks on a project since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual elements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome. It is an important component of strategic decisionmaking program and portfolio management and project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set. At these higher levels it is necessary to set realistic targets for the cost and duration of a project establish the contingency reserve levels required to protect the project stakeholders set appropriate project priorities and judge whether the risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances.  2.4 Stakeholder Risk Attitudes  The risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall project risk matters. A wide range of factors in  uence risk attitude. These include the scale of the project within the range of stakeholders overall activities the strength of public commitments made about the performance of the project and the stakeholders sensitivity to issues such as environmental impacts industrial relations and other factors. Stakeholder risk attitudes usually result in a desire for increased certainty in project outcomes and may express a preference for one project objective over another. How risk is regarded is usually also strongly in  uenced by an organizations culture. Different organizations are more or less open and this often impacts the way risk management can be applied. 1 CHAPTER 2  PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS Understanding stakeholders attitudes toward risk is an important component of risk management planning that precedes risk identification and analysis in order to optimize both project success and stakeholder satisfaction with the projects results. These attitudes should be identified and managed proactively and deliberately throughout the Project Risk Management process. They may differ from one project to another for the same stakeholders and will usually differ from one group of stakeholders to another. In fact a single stakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes at various stages in the same project.  It is also important to understand the particular implications of stakeholder risk attitudes on projects where the team is international crossindustry or multiorganizational.  2.5 Iterative Process  It is the nature of projects that circumstances change as they are being planned and executed. The amount of information available about risks will usually increase as time goes on. Some risks will occur while others will not new risks will arise or be discovered and the characteristics of those already identified may change. As a result the Project Risk Management processes should be repeated and the corresponding plans progressively elaborated throughout the lifetime of the project.  To ensure that Project Risk Management remains effective the identification and analysis of risks should be revisited periodically the progress on risk response actions should be monitored and the action plans adjusted accordingly. If external circumstances change significantly it may also be necessary to revisit the risk management planning process.  The development of an initial risk management plan and risk assessment is the start of the process not the end. The frequency and depth of reviews and updates will depend on the nature of the project the volatility of the environment in which the project is being implemented and the timing of other project management reviews and updates.  2.6 Communication  Project Risk Management cannot take place in isolation. Success relies heavily on communication throughout the process.  Risk identification and analysis depend on comprehensive input from stakeholders in a project to ensure that nothing significant is overlooked and that risks are realistically assessed. The credibility of the process and the commitment of those who should act to manage risks can be assured only if the way the process operates and the conclusions it produces are understood and seen as credible by all concerned. This demands effective and honest communication from the Project Risk Management process to the rest of the project team and other project stakeholders. Communication of the results of the Project Risk Management process should be targeted to meet the specific needs of each stakeholder and should be re  ected within the overall project communications strategy with each stakeholders responsibility and role in risk management identified and agreedupon. 1 CHAPTER 2  PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS 2.7 Responsibility for Project Risk Management  It may be considered simplistic to say risk management is everyones responsibility as previously stated. However it is important that management of project risk is not left to a few risk specialists. Project Risk Management should be included as an integral part of all other project processes. Since project risks can affect project objectives anyone with an interest in achieving those objectives should play a role in Project Risk Management. The specific roles depend on the project team members and other stakeholders place within the project and their relation to project objectives. Roles and responsibilities for Project Risk Management should be clearly defined and communicated and individuals should be held responsible and accountable for results. This includes allocating responsibility for specific activities within the risk process as well as for resulting actions required to implement agreedupon responses. Responsibility should also be allocated for ensuring that riskrelated lessons are captured for future use.  2.8 Project Managers Role for Project Risk Management  The project manager has particular responsibilities in relation to the Project Risk Management process. The project manager has overall responsibility for delivering a successful project which fully meets the defined objectives. The project manager is accountable for the daytoday management of the project including effective risk management. The role of the project manager may include  Encouraging senior management support for Project Risk Management activities.   Determining the acceptable levels of risk for the project in consultation with stakeholders.   Developing and approving the risk management plan.   Promoting the Project Risk Management process for the project.    Facilitating open and honest communication about risk within the project team and with  management and other stakeholders.  Participating in all aspects of the Project Risk Management process.   Approving risk responses and associated actions prior to implementation.   Applying project contingency funds to deal with identified risks that occur during the project.   Overseeing risk management by subcontractors and suppliers.    Regularly reporting risk status to key stakeholders with recommendations for appropriate strategic  decisions and actions to maintain acceptable risk exposure.   Escalating identified risks to senior management where appropriate such risks include any which are  outside the authority or control of the project manager any which require input or action from outside the project and any for which the release of management reserve funds might be appropriate.  Monitoring the efficiency and effectiveness of the Project Risk Management process.   Auditing risk responses for their effectiveness and documenting lessons learned.   1  CHAPTER 3  INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES  3.1 Project Risk Management and Project Management  All projects are uncertain. Uncertainty is inevitable since projects are unique and temporary undertakings based on assumptions and constraints delivering project results to multiple stakeholders with different requirements. Project management can be seen as an attempt to control this uncertain environment through the use of structured and disciplined techniques such as estimating planning cost control task allocation earned value analysis monitoring and review meetings etc. Each of these elements of project management has a role in defining or controlling the uncertainty which is inherent in all projects.  Project Risk Management provides an approach by which uncertainty can be understood assessed and managed within projects. As such it forms an integral part of project management and effective Project Risk Management is a critical success factor for project success.  For project management to be fully effective however it is important that Project Risk Management is not viewed as an optional process or performed as an additional overhead task. Since many elements of project management address inherent uncertainty the interface between structured Project Risk Management and the other processes of project management needs to be clear. The outputs of Project Risk Management should be taken into account within many of the project management processes. They can for example impact  Estimating resource requirements cost or duration   Assessing the impact of proposed scope changes   Planning or replanning the forward strategy of the project   Allocating resources to tasks and   Reporting progress to stakeholders.   None of these actions can be performed properly without a clear view of the risk involved as determined during the Project Risk Management process. In other words project management process effectiveness is increased by using the information and results from Project Risk Management.  In addition effective Project Risk Management requires input from other project management processes. Outputs such as the work breakdown structure WBS estimates the project schedule assumptions list etc. are all important prerequisites for effective Project Risk Management. 1 CHAPTER 3  INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES 3.2 Project Risk Management Processes  The defined steps of Project Risk Management describe a structured approach for understanding and managing risk on a project. This chapter outlines the steps required for effective Project Risk Management. Each step is described in more detail in subsequent chapters.  As previously defined project risk is an uncertain event or condition that if it occurs has a positive or negative effect on a projects objectives. From this definition it is clear that risks only exist in relation to objectives. It is therefore essential at the start of the Project Risk Management process to clearly define the objectives. It is also clear that different projects are exposed to different levels of risk so each step in the Project Risk Management process should be scalable to meet the varying degrees of risk. Scalable elements of the process include  Available resources   Methodology and processes used   Tools and techniques used   Supporting infrastructure   Review and update frequency and   Reporting requirements.   As a precondition for a successful Project Risk Management implementation it is important to have a clear understanding of the risk thresholds that define the key stakeholders views on acceptable levels of risk as well as a framework against which identified risks can be assessed.  As a result the Project Risk Management process always starts with an initiation step. This is required in order to ensure a common understanding and agreement of the team and other stakeholders on the approach and parameters that will be applied in managing risk in this project as well as the scope and objectives of the Project Risk Management process itself. Project Risk Management activities resources and attention should be appropriate to the project since different projects warrant different levels of risk management application. The main actions to provide the required tailoring are as follows  Define those objectives against which risks will be identified    Define how the elements of the Project Risk Management process will be scaled for this  project and  Define risk thresholds tolerances and the assessment framework.   The outputs from this initial step should be documented communicated and then reviewed by the stakeholders to ensure a common understanding of the scope and objectives for the Project Risk Management process. The document should be formally approved at a senior level. 1 CHAPTER 3  INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES Once the Project Risk Management scope and objectives are agreed upon it is possible to start identifying risks being careful to distinguish genuine risks from nonrisks such as causes effects problems issues etc.. A variety of risk identification techniques is available each with its own strengths and weaknesses. One or more techniques should be selected as appropriate for meeting the needs of the specific project. The aim is to expose and document all knowable risks recognizing that some risks will be inherently unknowable and others will emerge later in the project. The emergent nature of risk requires the Project Risk Management process to be iterative repeating the Identify Risks process in order to find risks which were not evident earlier in the project. Input should be sought from a wide range of project stakeholders when identifying risks since each will have a different perspective on the risks facing the project. Historical records and project documents should also be reviewed to identify risks for this project.  All identified risks are recorded. Ideally a risk owner is designated for each identified risk. It is the responsibility of the risk owner to manage the corresponding risk through all of the subsequent Project Risk Management processes.  Following risk identification it is necessary to evaluate the importance of each risk in order to prioritize individual risks for further attention evaluate the level of overall project risk and determine appropriate responses. Risk evaluation can be performed using qualitative techniques to address individual risks using quantitative techniques to consider the overall effect of risk on the project outcome or using both in combination. These two approaches require different types of data but where both qualitative and quantitative techniques are used an integrated approach should be adopted.  Qualitative techniques are used to gain a better understanding of individual risks considering a range of characteristics such as probability of occurrence degree of impact on project objectives manageability timing of possible impacts relationships with other risks common causes or effects etc. Understanding and prioritizing risks is an essential prerequisite to managing them so qualitative techniques are used on most projects. The outputs from qualitative assessments should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and form a basis for determining appropriate responses.  Quantitative techniques provide insights into the combined effect of identified risks on the project outcome. These techniques take into account probabilistic or projectwide effects such as correlation between risks interdependency and feedback loops thereby indicating the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The result is an indication of the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The results of quantitative analysis should be used to focus the development of appropriate responses particularly the calculation of required contingency reserve levels and must be documented and communicated to inform subsequent actions. Quantitative techniques may not be required for all projects to ensure effective management of risk. 1 CHAPTER 3  INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES Once individual risks have been prioritized and the degree of overall project risk exposure is understood appropriate risk responses should be developed using an iterative process which continues until an optimal set of responses has been developed. A range of possible response strategies exists for both threats and opportunities. The risk owner should select a suitable strategy for each individual risk based on its characteristics and assessed priority ensuring that the strategy is achievable affordable cost effective and appropriate. The use of a single strategy that addresses several related risks should be considered whenever possible. The risk owner is responsible for defining actions to implement the chosen strategy. These actions may be delegated to action owners as appropriate. The risk owner should monitor actions to determine their effectiveness and also to identify any secondary risks which may arise because of the implementation of risk responses. In addition to individual risk responses actions may be taken to respond to overall project risk. All response strategies and actions should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and incorporated into the project plan.  It is essential that agreedupon actions are implemented otherwise the risk exposure of the project remains unchanged. It is also vital that the Project Risk Management process be repeated at regular intervals throughout the life of the project. This will enable the project team to reevaluate the status of previously identified risks to identify emergent and secondary risks and to determine the effectiveness of the Project Risk Management process.  The steps outlined previously form the Project Risk Management process. These are detailed in subsequent chapters as follows     Plan Risk Management Chapter 4   Defines the scope and objectives of the Project Risk Management process and ensures that the risk process is fully integrated into wider project management.     Identify Risks Chapter 5    Identifies as many knowable risks as practicable.     Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Chapter 6   Evaluates key characteristics of individual risks enabling them to be prioritized for further action.     Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis Chapter 7   Evaluates the combined effect of risks on the overall project outcome.     Plan Risk Responses Chapter 8   Determines appropriate response strategies and actions for each individual risk and for overall project risk and integrates them into a consolidated project management plan.     Monitor and Control Risks Chapter 9   Implements agreedupon actions reviews changes in project risk exposure identifies additional risk management actions as required and assesses the effectiveness of the Project Risk Management process.  Figure 31 shows the   ow of control and information between the various steps within the Project Risk Management process. 1 CHAPTER 3  INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES  Figure 31. Project Risk Management Process Flow Diagram   1 CHAPTER 4  PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT  4.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Management Process  The objectives of the Plan Risk Management process are to develop the overall risk management strategy for the project to decide how the risk management processes will be executed and to integrate Project Risk Management with all other project management activities.  Effective risk management requires creation of a risk management plan. This plan describes how the risk management processes should be carried out and how they fit in with the other project management processes. On a broader level it describes the relationships among Project Risk Management general project management and the management processes in the rest of the organization. To provide the greatest benefit initial risk management planning should be carried out early in the overall planning of the project and the corresponding risk management activities integrated into the overall project management plan. The risk management plan may subsequently need to be adapted as the needs of the project and its stakeholders become clearer or change.  Although the Project Risk Management processes form an integral part of the overall project management plan a budget in terms of resources cost and time for the specific risk management activities should be established in order to better track control and as necessary defend the corresponding expenditures throughout the project. The cost of treating the risks themselves should be included appropriately in the project budget while the risk management plan should describe how this part of the project budget is evaluated allocated and managed. The risk management plan will define the monitoring methods to ensure that the corresponding expenditures are tracked appropriately as well as the conditions under which the approved budget for risk management can be modified.  In the same way that project management is a process of progressive elaboration risk management activities need to be repeated throughout the project. The risk management plan should define both the normal frequency for repeating the processes as well as specific or exceptional conditions under which the corresponding actions should be initiated. The corresponding risk management activities should be integrated into the project management plan.  There are two categories of success criteria for risk management those for success of the project in general and those for success of Project Risk Management. 204CHAPTER 4  PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT    ProjectRelated Criteria.  To assess the success of Project Risk Management the stakeholders must agree on an acceptable level of results for the projectrelated criteria such as cost time and scope. In order to ensure consistency and agreement among stakeholders the risk management plan should present these objectives with reference to the project definition documents. To provide guidance in risk management particularly in prioritizing risk responses stakeholders should also prioritize each project objective.     ProcessRelated Criteria.  The measures for success in Project Risk Management depend on a number of factors such as the inherent level of uncertainty of the project. For example the Project Risk Management process for a research project needs to address more unforeseen changes than for a project with a more predictable environment. A research Project Risk Management process may be considered a success even if it results in more variance from the baseline than would be allowable for a successful process in a more predictable project.  The level of risk that is considered acceptable in a project depends on the risk attitudes of the relevant stakeholders. The risk attitudes of both the organization and the stakeholders may be in  uenced by a number of factors all of which need to be identified. These include their inherent tolerance for uncertainty and the relative importance to them of achieving or missing specific project objectives. The output of this analysis should then be taken into account for setting thresholds and providing weighting factors when applying the Project Risk Management processes in the specific project.  Guidelines and rules for escalating riskrelated information to management and other stakeholders should re  ect the risk attitudes and expectations of the corresponding stakeholders. The project manager should maintain effective communication with the stakeholders as the project evolves in order to become aware of any changes in the stakeholders attitudes and adapt the risk management approach to take any new facts into account.  It is important that the participants share a common understanding of all terms used to describe the risks and that the critical values and thresholds that will serve as parameters for the tools should be defined in a manner consistent with the scope of the project and the attitudes of the stakeholders. If qualitative analysis uses such terms as high impact or medium probability these should be defined objectively in the risk management plan. Similarly the risk management plan should specify any key numerical values required in quantitative analysis or for decisionmaking in risk response planning or risk monitoring and control.  Risk management planning should establish the type and level of risk detail to be addressed and provide a template of the risk register that will be used for recording riskrelated information. The risk management plan should also indicate the intensity of effort and the frequency with which the various Project Risk Management processes should be applied this depends on the characteristics of the project as well as on the specified risk management objectives.  In order for the Project Risk Management processes to be carried out correctly and effectively the project team and other stakeholders need to know where and when they will be expected to participate their criteria for determining success their level of authority and what action to take relative to actions or decisions beyond this level. The risk management plan specifies the projects risk management roles and responsibilities and defines the corresponding expectations for both senior management and project personnel. 2 CHAPTER 4  PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT Riskrelated communication occurs at two levels a within the project team and b between the project team and the other project stakeholders. The principles for each of these categories of communication are defined in the risk management plan. For the team the plan describes the frequency and scope of the various risk management meetings and reports required to carry out the corresponding Project Risk Management processes as well as the structure and content of such meetings and reports. For the other stakeholders the plan sets their expectations as to the structure content and frequency of routine documents to be received as well as the way in which information will be shared for escalation or exceptional events. Details of the information required by the project team from stakeholders should also be clearly defined.  4.2 Critical Success Factors for the Plan Risk Management Process  The principal criteria for a valid risk management plan are acceptance by the stakeholders alignment with the internal and external constraints on the project balance between cost or effort and benefit and completeness with respect to the needs of the Project Risk Management process. Critical success factors for the Plan Risk Management process are detailed below.  4.2.1 Identify and Address Barriers to Successful Project Risk Management  The time and effort required to carry out the Plan Risk Management process will not be supported unless the stakeholders and especially management in the organization responsible for the project recognize and accept the benefits of managing risk and the added value of addressing this as a skill in its own right rather than as a passive or reactive component of general project management.  A clear definition of the project objectives and a highlevel view of the project environment and solution approach are required to provide a valid basis for risk management. The project manager should therefore ensure that valid definition and planning information is available for the plan risk management activity.  An organization inexperienced in risk management planning may need to develop its own approach and may expend an inappropriate amount of time and effort on this. Alternatively it may use a proprietary or preexisting approach which requires tailoring. The availability of some or all of the following organizational process assets contributes to the chances of success of the Plan Risk Management activities standard templates predefined risk categories and an established project management methodology incorporating risk management procedures that specify what risk information is required for decision making when it is required and a definition of concepts and terms roles responsibilities and authority levels. Access to relevant lessons learned at this stage will allow this experience to be taken into account from the start of the project.  The risk management plan will not deliver its value unless Project Risk Management is carried out as an integral part of the project. The corresponding activities should be built into the project work breakdown structure and included in the corresponding schedule budget and workassignment documents. 2 CHAPTER 4  PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT 4.2.2 Involve Project Stakeholders in Project Risk Management  The project manager needs to involve the project stakeholders in the Plan Risk Management activities to build on their skills and experience as well as to ensure their understanding of and commitment to the full Project Risk Management process.  The provision for risk management resources specified within the risk management plan should be approved by management at a level adequate for carrying out the required Project Risk Management processes in accordance with agreedupon objectives. Management should be involved in the analysis of the level of resourcing required for managing project risk and accept the risks that may arise from specific limitations placed on the provision of resources. Disagreements between stakeholders in the areas of risk tolerance and evaluation measures should be addressed and resolved.  4.2.3 Comply with the Organizations Objectives Policies and Practices  The feasibility of risk management planning is dependent upon the features of the organization in which it is carried out. The rules and guidelines defined in the risk management plan should be compatible with the culture of the organization its capabilities from the point of view of people and facilities and its values goals and objectives.  Project management in general and risk management in particular contribute to the organizations effective governance. The risk management plan should identify and take into account the relevant organizational procedures and any other enterprise environmental factors that apply such as strategic risk management or corporate governance processes.  4.3 Tools and Techniques for the Plan Risk Management Process  4.3.1 Planning Sessions  Planning sessions are recommended in order to build a common understanding of the projects risk approach between project stakeholders and to gain agreement on the techniques to be used for managing risk.  Elaboration of the risk management plan often serves to develop an effective means for the team to work together since a similar consultative team approach will be used in subsequent stages of the risk management process. The participants should include the project manager selected project team members and other stakeholders members of the broader organization having responsibility for risk and other subject matter experts or facilitators as needed.  At this point the initial risk responsibilities methodology templates terms definitions time schedules and cost budgets for the other Project Risk Management processes should be assigned and accepted. The specification for the tools that will be used in subsequent processes should include all parameters and other inputs required to ensure their applicability to the specific project. These should be documented in the risk management plan which when formally approved is the principal deliverable of the Plan Risk Management process. 2 CHAPTER 4  PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT 4.3.2 Templates  In order to benefit from experience and existing best practice risk management planning should take into account relevant existing templates for work products such as risk status reports risk breakdown structures or the risk register. A decision should be made as to which templates are relevant to the project and these should then be adapted and included in the risk management plan.  4.4 Documenting the Results of the Plan Risk Management Process  The results of risk management planning are documented in the risk management plan. The plan serves to provide all project stakeholders with a common view of how the riskrelated activities of the project will be handled what has been agreed upon and a description of the stakeholders involvement and responsibilities in these activities. An overview of the key areas of focus is given in Figure 41.   Figure 41. Key Areas of Focus for the Plan Risk Management Process   Depending upon the size and complexity of the project some or all of the following elements will be present in a risk management plan.  Introduction   Project description   Risk management methodology   Risk management organization   Roles responsibilities and authority   Stakeholder risk tolerance   Criteria for success   Risk management tools and guidelines for use   Thresholds and corresponding definitions   Templates   Communications plan   Strategy and   Risk breakdown structure.  2 CHAPTER 5  IDENTIFY RISKS  5.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Identify Risks Process  A risk cannot be managed unless it is first identified. Consequently after risk management planning has been completed the first process in the iterative Project Risk Management process aims to identify all the knowable risks to project objectives.  It is however impossible to identify all the risks at the outset of a project. Over time the level of project risk exposure changes as a result of the decisions and actions taken previously in the project internal change and of externally imposed change.  The purpose of risk identification is to identify risks to the maximum extent that is practicable. The fact that some risks are unknowable or emergent requires the Identify Risk process to be iterative repeating the Identify Risks process to find new risks which have become knowable since the previous iteration of the process.  When a risk is first identified potential responses may also be identified at the same time. These should be recorded during the Identify Risks process and considered for immediate action if such action is appropriate. Where such responses are not implemented immediately these should be considered during the Plan Risk Responses process.  5.2 Critical Success Factors for the Identify Risks Process  The practices described in Sections 5.2.1 through 5.2.10 will maximize the value and effectiveness of the Identify Risks process and enhance the likelihood of identifying as many risks as practicable.  5.2.1 Early Identification  Risk identification should be performed as early as possible in the project lifecycle recognizing the paradox that uncertainty is high in the initial stages of a project so there is often less information on which to base the risk identification. Early risk identification enables key project decisions to take maximum account of risks inherent in the project and may result in changes to the project strategy. It also maximizes the time available for development and implementation of risk responses which enhances efficiency since responses taken early are often normally less costly than later ones. 2 CHAPTER 5  IDENTIFY RISKS 5.2.2 Iterative Identification  Since not all risks can be identified at any given point in the project it is essential that risk identification is repeated throughout the project life cycle. This should be done periodically at a frequency determined during the Plan Risk Management process. Risk identification might also be repeated at key milestones in the project or whenever there is significant change to the project or its operating environment.  5.2.3 Emergent Identification  In addition to invoking the Identify Risks process as defined in the project plan the Project Risk Management process should permit risks to be identified at any time not limited to formal risk identification events or regular reviews.  5.2.4 Comprehensive Identification  A broad range of sources of risk should be considered to ensure that as many uncertainties as possible that might affect objectives have been identified.  5.2.5 Explicit Identification of Opportunities  The Identify Risks process should ensure opportunities are properly considered.  5.2.6 Multiple Perspectives  The Identify Risks process should take input from a broad range of project stakeholders to ensure that all perspectives are represented and considered. Limiting risk identification to the immediate project team is unlikely to expose all knowable risks.  5.2.7 Risks Linked to Project Objectives  Each identified project risk should relate to at least one project objective time cost quality scope etc. noting that the  PMBOK     Guide  defines risk as an uncertain event or condition that if it occurs has a positive or a negative effect on a projects objectives. Consideration of each project objective during the Identify Risks process will assist in identifying risks noting that some risks may affect more than one objective.  5.2.8 Complete Risk Statement  Identified risks should be clearly and unambiguously described so that they can be understood by those responsible for risk assessment and risk response planning. Single words or phrases such as resources or logistics are inadequate and do not properly communicate the nature of the risk. More detailed risk descriptions are required which explicitly state the uncertainty and its causes and effects. 2 CHAPTER 5  IDENTIFY RISKS 5.2.9 Ownership and Level of Detail  Risks can be identified at a number of levels of detail. A generalized or highlevel description of risk can make it difficult to develop responses and assign ownership while describing risks in a lot of detail can create a great deal of work. Each risk should be described at a level of detail at which it can be assigned to a single risk owner with clear responsibility and accountability for its management. Trigger conditions should also be identified where this is possible and appropriate.  5.2.10 Objectivity  All human activities are susceptible to bias especially when dealing with uncertainty. Both motivational biases where someone is trying to bias the result in one direction or another or cognitive biases where biases occur as people are using their best judgment and applying heuristics may occur. This should be explicitly recognized and addressed during the Identify Risks process. Sources of bias should be exposed wherever possible and their effect on the risk process should be managed proactively. The aim is to minimize subjectivity and allow open and honest identification of as many risks as possible to the project.  5.3 Tools and Techniques for the Identify Risks Process  A range of tools and techniques is available for risk identification. These fall into the following three categories as illustrated in Figure 51  Figure 51. Three Perspectives of Risk Identification 2 CHAPTER 5  IDENTIFY RISKS 5.3.1 Historical Review  Historical reviews are based on what occurred in the past either on this project or other similar projects in the same organization or comparable projects in other organizations. Historical review approaches rely on careful selection of comparable situations which are genuinely similar to the current project and filtering of data to ensure that only relevant previous risks are considered. In each case the risks identified in the selected historical situation should be considered asking whether they or similar risks might arise in this project.  5.3.2 Current Assessments  Current assessments rely on detailed consideration of the current project analyzing its characteristics against given frameworks and models in order to expose areas of uncertainty. Unlike historical review approaches current assessment techniques do not rely on outside reference points but are based purely on examination of the project.  5.3.3 Creativity Techniques  A wide range of creativity techniques can be used for risk identification which encourages project stakeholders to use their imagination to find risks which might affect the project. The outcomes or effectiveness of these techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively. These techniques can be used either singly or in groups and employ varying degrees of structure. These techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively and their success is enhanced by use of a skilled facilitator.  Each category of risk identification technique has strengths and weaknesses and no single technique can be expected to reveal all knowable risks. Consequently the Identify Risks process for a particular project should use a combination of techniques perhaps selecting one from each category. For example a project may choose to use a risk identification checklist historical review together with assumptions analysis current assessment and brainstorming creativity.  Use of a risk breakdown structure which organizes the categories of potential risks on the project a prompt list or a set of generic list categories may assist in ensuring that as many sources of risk as practicable have been addressed while recognizing that no such tools are complete nor can they replace original thinking. 2 CHAPTER 5  IDENTIFY RISKS Whichever risk identification techniques are used it is important that identified risks are unambiguously described in order to ensure that the project risk process is focused on the actual risks and not distracted or diluted by nonrisks. Use of structured risk descriptions can ensure clarity. Risk metalanguage offers a useful way of distinguishing a risk from its causes and effects describing each risk using threepart statements in the form As a result of cause risk may occur which would lead to effect. The relationship between cause risk and effect is shown in Figure 52.   Figure 52. Cause Risk and Effect   5.4 Documenting the Results of the Identify Risks Process  The results from the Identify Risks process should be recorded in order to capture all relevant information currently available for each identified risk. The main output from the Identify Risks process is the risk register. This includes a properly structured risk description and the nominated risk owner for each risk and may also include information on the causes and effects of the risk trigger conditions and preliminary responses. 3 CHAPTER 6  PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS  6.1  Purpose and Objectives of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process  The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process assesses and evaluates characteristics of individually identified project risks and prioritizes risks based on agreedupon characteristics.  Assessing individual risks using qualitative risk analysis evaluates the probability that each risk will occur and the effect of each individual risk on the project objectives. As such it does not directly address the overall risk to project objectives that results from the combined effect of all risks and their potential interactions with each other. This can however be achieved through use of quantitative risk analysis techniques see Chapter 7.  One step in the analysis is to categorize risks according to their sources or causes. If several risks arise from a common source sometimes called a root cause risk responses may be more effective when they focus on addressing this root cause.  Identifying common effects from groups of risks allows identification of the areas of greatest risk exposure e.g. to the project completion date the budget or a particular deliverables scope facilitating risk response focus in these areas.  The methods of qualitative risk analysis are applied to the list of risks created or updated by the Identify Risks process to provide project management with the characteristics of the risks that have the most in  uence positive or negative on achieving the projects objectives. Risks that are assessed as high priority to either threaten or to enhance the achievement of project objectives will be an important focus in the Plan Risk Responses process. They may be further analyzed such as in the analysis of the overall project risk that is discussed in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process.  6.2  Critical Success Factors for the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process  Several factors that lead to successful qualitative risk analysis are described in Sections 6.2.1 through 6.2.4 and summarized in Figure 61. Agreement of the project stakeholders is a fundamental criterion and a common theme. The agreedupon approach is the foundation of process credibility. Then agreedupon definitions enable highquality information to be collected. Finally with these conditions in place the process can be executed reliably which contributes to the credibility of its outputs. 3 CHAPTER 6  PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS  Figure 6 1. Building Risk Analysis Credibility   6.2.1 Use AgreedUpon Approach  The process is based on an agreedupon approach to this assessment that is applied across all of the identified risks in any project. By the nature of project risk all risks may be assessed according to probability of occurrence and impact on individual objectives should the risk occur. Other factors may be considered in determining the importance of a risk as follows     Urgency proximity.  Risks requiring near term responses may be considered more urgent to address. Indicators of urgency can include the lead time necessary to execute a risk response and the clarity of symptoms and warning signs also known as detectability that may trigger the response.    Manageability.   Some risks are not manageable and it would be a waste of resources to attempt to address them. The project team may examine these and decide to  Go forward perhaps establishing a contingency reserve.    Stop or rescope the project because these risks pose an unmanageable threat or an   opportunity that should not be missed with high probability and consequences.  Inform the customer of the risks and ask for a decision from their point of view.     Impact external to the project.    A risk may increase in importance if it affects the enterprise beyond the project.  6.2.2 Use AgreedUpon Definitions of Risk Terms  The risk assessment should be based on agreedupon definitions of important terms and those definitions should be used consistently when assessing each risk. The use of definitions for example of levels of probability and of impact on objectives assists the providers of the information in giving realistic assessments for each risk and facilitates the communication of the results to management and other stakeholders. 3 CHAPTER 6  PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS 6.2.3 Collect HighQuality Information about Risks  Collection of highquality information about risks is required. Often this information is not available in any historic database and should be gathered by interviews workshops and other means using expert judgment. Data gathered from individuals may be subject to reporting or intentional bias. When this occurs the bias should be identified and remedied where possible or a different unbiased source of information should be found and used.  6.2.4 Perform Iterative Qualitative Risk Analysis  The success of qualitative risk analysis is enhanced if the process is used periodically throughout the project. It is impossible to know in advance all the risks that may occur in a project therefore the Identify Risks and Perform Qualitative Analysis processes should be repeated periodically for individual risks. The frequency of this effort will be planned in the Plan Risk Management process but may also depend on events within the project itself.  6.3  Tools and Techniques for the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process  The tools and techniques used for assessing individual risks will identify the risks that are important to the projects success. This process is illustrated in Figure 62.   Figure 62. The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process 3 CHAPTER 6  PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS  6.3.1 Select Risk Characteristics that Define Risks Importance  Qualitative risk analysis tools provide ways to distinguish those risks that are important for response or further analysis from those that are less important. The criteria that make a risk of interest to management are agreed upon in advance and implemented in the tools used. Output from qualitative risk analysis tools includes a listing of risks in priority order or in priority groups e.g. high moderate and low.  The tools for qualitative risk analysis allow the organization or project stakeholders to specify those levels or combinations of risk characteristics that make a particular risk of interest to management. Most tools assess a risks importance from a combination of probability of occurrence and degree of impact on objectives.  6.3.2 Collect and Analyze Data  Assessment of individual risks is based on information collected about them. Therefore data collection and evaluation tools including interviews workshops and references to databases of prior projects require management support and attention. It is important to protect against bias in data gathering which is important when relying on expert judgment for the information.  6.3.3 Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Specific Objectives  Some tools permit distinguishing a risks priority in terms of the affected objective. This capability provides a list of risks that are important for any specific objective of interest to management. This is useful since it is common for risks to have uneven impacts on various project objectives.  6.3.4 Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Overall Project  There are reasons for constructing a measure of a specific risks importance to the entire project as contrasted with its importance to specific objectives. A common reason is for ease of communication with management and other stakeholders. When a single risk prioritization index is needed the organization should be explicit about how that index is created. Usually the index re  ects the organizations preference among objectives. The technique for creating the overall risk priority measure should be documented in the Plan Risk Management process. 3 CHAPTER 6  PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS 6.3.5 Categorize Risk Causes  Categorizing risks appropriately may lead to improved analysis of the probability and magnitude of project risk and to effective responses. Understanding the relationships between risks may provide a better understanding of the possibility and magnitude of project risk than if risks are only considered as separate and independent events. Identifying common root causes of a group of risks for instance may reveal both the magnitude of the risk event for the group as a whole along with effective strategies that might address several risks simultaneously. Alternatively some risks may be linked with others in a causal chain and understanding the chain of risks may lead to a better understanding of the implication of risk for the project. Identifying risks that can occur at the same time or using the same resources for recovery might provide a realistic picture of problems of risk mitigation using scarce resources.  Combining the results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process with the risk breakdown structure see Identify Risks Chapter 5 can show clusters of priority risks arising from specific sources. A combination of the risk analysis information with the work breakdown structure WBS can show which areas of the project exhibit the most risk. Assessing the highpriority risks impact on one objective such as the schedule may indicate which activities to address to reduce that objectives uncertainty. All of these approaches can contribute to the realism and usefulness of the qualitative risk analysis.  6.3.6 Document the Results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process  The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process adds structure to the list of undifferentiated risks see Identify Risks Chapter 5 into categories of priority. Priorities are usually based on the risks probability of occurring and its potential impact on specific project objectives or on the whole project. Each identified risk is assigned a priority perhaps by objective or for the entire project. This information is usually stored in the risk register which is easy to use and update with new information. The risk register list of prioritized risks is posted to the project participants who are responsible for further analysis or action to improve the project plan. Risks that are judged to have high priority are segregated for further analysis and response planning and are generally monitored frequently. Risks of low priority to the project may be placed on a watch list and are reviewed less often for changes in their status. 3 CHAPTER 7  PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS  7.1  Purpose and Objectives of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis Process  The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process provides a numerical estimate of the overall effect of risk on the objectives of the project based on current plans and information when considering risks simultaneously. Results from this type of analysis can be used to evaluate the likelihood of success in achieving project objectives and to estimate contingency reserves usually for time and cost that are appropriate to both the risks and the risk tolerance of project stakeholders.  It is generally accepted that analyzing uncertainty in the project using quantitative techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation may provide more realism in the estimate of the overall project cost or schedule than a nonprobabilistic approach which assumes that the activity durations or lineitem cost estimates are deterministic. However it should be recognized that quantitative risk analysis is not always required or appropriate for all projects. For example qualitative risk analysis may provide enough information for development of effective risk responses especially for smaller projects. Therefore during the Plan Risk Management process the benefits of quantitative risk analysis should be weighed against the effort required to ensure that the additional insights and value justify the additional effort.  Partial risk analyses such as qualitative risk analysis aim at prioritizing individual risks viewed one at a time and therefore cannot produce measures of overall project risk when all risks are considered simultaneously. Calculating estimates of overall project risk is the focus of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process.  Specific project risks are usually best understood and quantified at a detailed level such as the lineitem cost or schedule activity level. By contrast project objectives such as achievement of the projects budget or the schedule are specified at a higher level often at the level of the total project. An overall risk analysis such as one that uses quantitative techniques estimates the implication of all quantified risks on project objectives. The implementation of overall risk analysis using quantitative methods requires   Complete and accurate representation of the project objectives built up from individual project  elements. Examples of these representations include the project schedule or cost estimate.   Identifying risks on individual project elements such as schedule activities or lineitem costs at a  level of detail that lends itself to specific assessment of individual risks.   Including generic risks that have a broader effect than individual project elements.    Applying a quantitative method such as Monte Carlo simulation or decision tree analysis that incorporates  multiple risks simultaneously in determining overall impact on the overall project objective. 3 CHAPTER 7  PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS Results of the quantitative analysis will be compared to the project plan baseline or current to give management an estimate of the overall project risk and will answer important questions such as  What is the probability of meeting the projects objectives    How much contingency reserve e.g. reserves or buffers of time resources and cost is needed to  provide the organization with the level of certainty it requires based upon its risk tolerance   What are those parts of the project such as lineitem costs or schedule activities which contribute  the most risk when all risks are considered simultaneously  Which individual risks contribute the most to overall project risk   Estimating overall project risk using quantitative methods helps distinguish those projects where quantified risks threaten objectives beyond the tolerance of the stakeholders from those for which the objectives are within acceptable tolerances even when risk is considered. The former may be targeted for vigorous risk responses aimed at protecting those objectives most important to the stakeholders.  A highlevel comparison of quantitative and qualitative risk analysis processes is presented in Figure 71.   Figure 71. Comparison of Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches   7.2  Critical Success Factors for the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis Process  Success in achieving the objectives of quantitative risk analysis depends explicitly on at least the factors described in Sections 7.2.1 through 7.2.6. 3 CHAPTER 7  PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS 7.2.1 Prior Risk Identification and Qualitative Risk Analysis  The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process occurs after the Identify Risks and Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis processes have been completed. Reference to a prioritized list of identified risks ensures that the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process will consider all significant risks when analyzing their effects quantitatively.  7.2.2 Appropriate Project Model  An appropriate model of the project should be used as the basis for quantitative risk analysis. Project models most frequently used in quantitative risk analysis include the project schedule for time lineitem cost estimates for cost decision tree for decisions in the face of uncertainty and other totalproject models. Quantitative risk analysis is especially sensitive to the completeness and correctness of the model of the project that is used.  7.2.3 Commitment to Collecting HighQuality Risk Data  Often highquality data about risks are not available in any historic database and should be gathered by interviews workshops and other means using expert judgment of those present. Collection of risk data requires resources and time as well as management support.  7.2.4 Unbiased Data  Success in gathering risk analysis data requires the ability to recognize when biases occur and combating that bias or developing other unbiased sources of the data. Bias in risk data can occur for many reasons but two common sources of bias are cognitive bias and motivational bias.  7.2.5 Overall Project Risk Derived from Individual Risks  The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is based upon a methodology that correctly derives the overall project risk from the individual risks. In risk analysis of cost and schedule for example an appropriate method is Monte Carlo simulation. A decision tree is an appropriate method for making decisions when future events are not certain using the probability and impact of all risks and combining their effect to derive an overall project measure such as value or cost. In each of these methods the risks are specified at the level of the detailed tasks or lineitem costs and incorporated into the model of the project to calculate effects on objectives such as schedule or cost for the entire project by combining those risks. 4 CHAPTER 7  PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS 7.2.6 Interrelationships Between Risks in Quantitative Risk Analysis  Attention should be given to the possibility that the individual risks in the project model are related to each other. For example several risks may have a common root cause and therefore are likely to occur together. This possibility is sometimes addressed by correlating the risks that are related ensuring that they generally occur together during the analysis. Another common way to represent the risks which occur together is by using the risk register listing of the risk or root cause and attaching it to several project elements such as schedule activities or cost elements. When a particular risk occurs the affected elements will all experience the effect of that risk together.  7.3  Tools and Techniques for the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis Process  Tools and techniques used appropriately for quantitative risk analysis have several characteristics as follows  7.3.1 Comprehensive Risk Representation  Risk models permit representation of many if not all of the risks that have impact on an objective simultaneously. They also permit the representation of both opportunities and threats to the projects objectives.  7.3.2 Risk Impact Calculation  Quantitative models facilitate the correct calculation of the effect of many risks which are typically identified and quantified at a level of detail below the total project on the project objectives which are typically described at the level of the total project.  7.3.3 Quantitative Method Appropriate to Analyzing Uncertainty  Probability models use a quantitative method that addresses uncertainty. Specifically the methods should be able to handle the way uncertainty is represented predominantly as probability of an events occurring or as probability distributions for a range of outcomes. A good example of this is the use of Monte Carlo simulation tools that permit the combination of probability distributions of lineitem costs or schedule activity durations many of which are uncertain.  7.3.4 Data Gathering Tools  Data gathering tools used in this process include assessment of historical data and workshops interviews or questionnaires to gather quantified informationfor example on the probability of a risk occurring a probability distribution of its potential impacts on cost or time or relationships such as correlation between risks. 4 CHAPTER 7  PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS 7.3.5 Effective Presentation of Quantitative Analysis Results  Results from the quantitative tools are generally not available in standard deterministic project management methods such as project scheduling or cost estimating. Examples of these are the probability distribution of project completion dates or total costs and the expected value of a project decision. These results when all risks are considered simultaneously include the following  Probability of achieving a project objective such as finishing on time or within budget.    Amount of contingency reserve in cost time or resources needed to provide a required level of  confidence.   Identity or location within the project model of the most important risks. An example of this is a  sensitivity analysis in a cost risk analysis or a criticality analysis in a schedule risk analysis.  The elements of a quantitative risk analysis are illustrated in Figure 72.   Figure 72. Structure of a Quantitative Risk Analysis 4 CHAPTER 7  PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS  7.3.6 Iterative Quantitative Risk Analysis  The success of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is enhanced if the process is used periodically throughout the project. It is impossible to know in advance all of the risks that may occur in a project. Often quantitative risk analysis should be repeated as the project proceeds. The frequency of this effort will be determined during the Plan Risk Management process but will also depend on events within the project itself see Monitor and Control Risks Chapter 9.  7.3.7 Information for Response Planning  Overall project contingency reserve in time and cost should be re  ected in the projects schedule and budget. Quantitative risk analysis provides information that may be used to modify the project plan. If the overall risk to time and cost indicates that an adjustment in scope is needed the scope changes are agreed upon and documented and a new quantitative risk analysis is carried out to re  ect the new aspects of the project.  7.4  Documenting the Results of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis Process  The contingency reserves calculated in quantitative project cost and schedule risk analysis are incorporated respectively into the cost estimate and the schedule to establish a prudent target and a realistic expectation for the project. Contingency reserves may also be established to provide for the capture of opportunities that are judged to be priorities for the project. If the contingency reserve required exceeds the time or resources available changes in the project scope and plan may result.  Also the results of the analysis may provide more or less urgency to risk response see Plan Risk Responses Chapter 8 depending on the probability of achieving the plans objectives or the amount of contingency reserve required to provide the necessary level of confidence. The results of a quantitative risk analysis are recorded and passed on to the person andor group responsible for project management within the organization for any further actions required to make full use of these results. 4 CHAPTER 8  PLAN RISK RESPONSES  The Plan Risk Responses process determines effective response actions that are appropriate to the priority of the individual risks and to the overall project risk. It takes into account the stakeholders risk attitudes and the conventions specified in the Risk Management Plan in addition to any constraints and assumptions that were determined when the risks were identified and analyzed.  8.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Responses Process  The objective of the Plan Risk Responses process is to determine the set of actions which most enhance the chances of project success while complying with applicable organizational and project constraints.  Once risks have been identified analyzed and prioritized plans should be developed for addressing every risk the project team considers to be sufficiently important either because of the threat it poses to the project objectives or the opportunity it offers. The planning entails agreeing upon the actions to be taken and the potential changes to budget schedule resources and scope which these actions might cause.  Contingent risk response actions need to be executed at the optimum time. For this reason the response specification for each such risk should include a description of any corresponding trigger conditions.  The responsibility for monitoring the project conditions and implementing the corresponding actions should be clearly assigned. Every risk should have been allocated to a risk owner as part of the Identify Risks process and each of the corresponding risk responses should now be assigned to a specific risk action owner. The risk owner is responsible for ensuring that the risk response is effective and for planning additional risk responses if required whereas the risk action owner is responsible for ensuring that the agreedupon risk responses are carried out as planned in a timely manner. The role of the risk owner and that of the risk action owner may be assigned to a single person.  Responses when implemented can have potential effects on the project objectives and as such can generate additional risks. These are known as secondary risks and have to be analyzed and planned for in the same way as those risks which were initially identified.  It is never feasible or even desirable to eliminate all threats from a project. Similarly there is also a limit to the extent to which opportunities can be proactively managed. There may be residual risks that will remain after the responses have been implemented. These residual risks should be clearly identified analyzed documented and communicated to all relevant stakeholders. 4 CHAPTER 8  PLAN RISK RESPONSES All the approved unconditional actions arising from risk response planning should be integrated into the project management plan in order to ensure that they are carried out as part of normal project implementation. The corresponding organizational and project management rules should also be invoked including the following  Project change management and configuration control   Project planning budgeting and scheduling   Resource management and   Project communication planning.   8.2 Critical Success Factors for the Plan Risk Responses Process  A range of factors are important for the success of the Plan Risk Responses process. These are described in Sections 8.2.1 through 8.2.8 and shown in Figure 81.   Figure 81. Critical Success Factors for Risk Response Planning   8.2.1 Communicate  Communication with the various stakeholders should be maintained in an open and appropriate manner. The resulting plans are disseminated and approval obtained in order to ensure full acceptance by all stakeholders.  In addition if organizational causes of risks such as culture attitudes or disagreements concerning objectives are present they should be addressed openly. This may require involving high levels of the organizations management and other stakeholders. 4 CHAPTER 8  PLAN RISK RESPONSES 8.2.2 Clearly Define RiskRelated Roles and Responsibilities  The risk response success will be dependent upon the full support and involvement of the project team and other stakeholders. The key roles for Project Risk Management are those of risk owner and risk action owner. A single risk owner should be assigned to every identified risk and each agreedupon risk response should have a single risk action owner. The people with the corresponding responsibilities should be aware of what is expected of them and the other project stakeholders should understand and accept the needs and authority of these roles.  Management may take ownership of risks with political organizational causes. In addition senior management should approve and track associated riskrelated contingency reserves.  8.2.3 Specify Timing of Risk Responses  Agreedupon responses should be integrated into the project management plan and will therefore be scheduled and assigned for execution. The responses that depend on uncertain conditions should also be monitored so as to be performed if the conditions warrant them.  8.2.4 Provide Resources Budget and Schedule for Responses  Each response should be planned in detail in accordance with the methodology of the project and integrated into the project management plan. This entails estimating the resources costs and duration updating the budget and schedule obtaining approval from management and obtaining commitment from the risk owners and risk action owners. Managements role at this stage is vital for supporting the project manager in developing risk responses and authorizing the corresponding resources.  8.2.5 Address the Interaction of Risks and Responses  Responses may be developed to address risks related either by cause and effect or by common root cause. Categorization of risks for example by using tools such as the risk breakdown structure affinity diagram or other categorizing tools may help identify and address this situation. There is also a need during the Plan Risk Responses process to consider the risks aggregated during the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process e.g. ten small related risks combined may pose a big risk to the project and then to develop generic responses where possible. Another interaction effect that may occur is when one risk if it occurs may affect the probability or impact of other risks.  Deciding on the response strategy may require a compromise since some proposed responses may be mutually exclusive or counterproductive. For example mitigating a threat to time could cost money thereby increasing pressure on the budget. Risk response planning also needs to take a holistic view of all proposed responses and make sure they are coherent. 4 CHAPTER 8  PLAN RISK RESPONSES The challenge therefore in planning responses to risks is the need to control the potential effects of the strategy developed for treating the original risk. If this is overlooked the total level of threat in a project can actually increase or the potential for opportunities can be compromised.  8.2.6 Ensure Appropriate Timely Effective and AgreedUpon Responses  In general responses should be appropriate timely costeffective feasible achievable agreedupon assigned and accepted. Any proposed risk response plan needs to be assessed against the following criteria  Consistency with organizational values project objectives and stakeholder expectations   Technical feasibility    Ability of the project team or risk action owners outside the project to carry out the corresponding  actions and   Balance between overall impact of the response on the project objectives and the improvement in  the risk profile of the project.  8.2.7 Address Both Threats and Opportunities  Risk response planning should combine responses that address the threats as well as those that provide for opportunities into a single integrated plan. If either threats or opportunities are not fully addressed the combined set of response strategies will be incomplete and may even be invalid.  8.2.8 Develop Strategies before Tactical Responses  Risk response planning should be carried out in an openminded manner rather than adopting the first response that seems to be feasible. The responses should be planned at a general strategic level and the strategy validated and agreed upon prior to developing the detailed tactical approach.  Once the responses have been planned at a strategic level they should be expanded into actions at the tactical level and integrated into the project management plan e.g. schedule budget and resource assignments. This activity may generate additional secondary risks which will need to be addressed at this time.  8.3 Risk Response Strategies  The project manager should develop risk response strategies for individual risks sets of risks and projectlevel risks. An overview of the steps in arriving at a complete set of responses is given in Figure 82.  The affected stakeholders should be involved in determining the strategies. Once the strategies have been selected they need to be agreed upon by the entity that approves those strategies. There are four strategies which address individual risks for threats and opportunities as described in Sections 8.3.1 through 8.3.4 see also Fig. 82. 4 CHAPTER 8  PLAN RISK RESPONSES 8.3.1 Avoid a Threat or Exploit an Opportunity  This strategy involves taking the actions required to address a threat or an opportunity in order to ensure either that the threat cannot occur or can have no effect on the project or that the opportunity will occur and the project will be able to take advantage of it.  8.3.2 Transfer a Threat or Share an Opportunity  This strategy entails transference to a third party that is better positioned to address a particular threat or opportunity.  8.3.3 Mitigate a Threat or Enhance an Opportunity  Mitigation and enhancement are the most widely applicable and widely used response strategies. Here the approach is to identify actions that will decrease the probability andor the impact of a threat and increase the probability andor the impact of an opportunity.  8.3.4 Accept a Threat or an Opportunity  This strategy applies when the other strategies are not considered applicable or feasible. Acceptance entails taking no action unless the risk actually occurs in which case contingency or fallback plans may be developed ahead of time to be implemented if the risk presents itself.  8.3.5 Applying Risk Response Strategies to Overall Project Risk  In addition to responding to individual risks the four risk response strategies can be applied to address overall project risk as follows  Cancel the project as a last resort if the overall level of risk remains unacceptable.   Set up a business structure in which the customer and the supplier share the risk.    Replan the project or change the scope and boundaries of the project for example by modifying the  project priority resource allocations delivery calendar etc.  Pursue the project despite a risk exposure that exceeds the desired level.   8.4 Tools and Techniques for the Plan Risk Responses Process  There are four categories of tools and techniques as follows  Creativity tools to identify potential responses   Decisionsupport tools for determining the optimal potential response.   Strategy implementation techniques designed to turn a strategy into action and   Tools to transfer control to the Monitor and Control Risks process.  4 CHAPTER 8  PLAN RISK RESPONSES These categories of tools can be used respectively to identify potential responses select the most appropriate response translate strategy into planning and assign the corresponding actions. The steps involved in planning risk responses are shown in Figure 8.2.  8.4.1 Response Identification  Risk response planning builds on the available information about the potential risks and aims to determine the optimal set of responses. For this reason it should involve subject matter experts and employ creativity techniques in order to explore all of the options. Project planning and execution techniques are then required to evaluate the potential effects of the various options on the projects objectives.  8.4.2 Response Selection  Once the set of potential responses for the risks being addressed is established decisionsupport techniques may need to be applied to select the best possible subset from these responses. The selection process should take into account the cost of the responses the impact on the project objectives uncertainty of outcomes and the possible secondary and residual risks. The Identify Risks Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis and Plan Risk Responses processes may then need to be applied to the resultant project management plan and the residual and secondary risks that it would entail. This iterative approach continues until all of the individual risks are deemed acceptable and the overall risk is within a predefined threshold.  8.4.3 Action Planning  Project planning tools are used to turn the chosen strategies into concrete actions and to integrate these into existing plans. The corresponding actions may be unconditional i.e. integrated into the project management plan or contingent on a trigger condition and predefined as a contingency response strategy.  8.4.4 Ownership and Responsibility Assignment  The project manager needs to use resource assignment processes to ensure the availability of an owner for each risk and for each response action so that each associated risk is managed and each corresponding risk response is carried out in a timely and effective manner.  To enable risk monitoring to identify the imminence or actual occurrence of the corresponding event every contingency response strategy should include a set of trigger conditions. The responsibility for monitoring these conditions should be clearly assigned in the Plan Risk Responses process and managed in the Monitor and Control Risks process. 4 CHAPTER 8  PLAN RISK RESPONSES The strategic definition of risk responses should include measurable criteria for success of the response. Risk action owners should monitor their assigned risks take agreedupon actions as required and provide the risk owners with relevant information on status or changes to the risk characteristics. Risk owners should assess the effectiveness of any actions decide whether additional actions are required and keep the project manager informed of the situation.   Figure 82. The Steps Involved in Planning Risk Responses 5 CHAPTER 8  PLAN RISK RESPONSES  8.5 Documenting the Results of the Plan Risk Responses Process  Risk response planning is based on the information placed in the risk register during execution of the Identify Risks and Perform Analysis processes. The corresponding risk response information is often referred to as the risk response plan although it may in fact be an integral part of the risk register.  8.5.1 Add Risk Responses to the Risk Register  The responserelated information for each risk is recorded in the risk register and updated regularly. Any interested stakeholder should be able to rapidly access all the information required to verify their responsibilities and manage the risk in accordance with the risk response plan. The set of residual risks and their priorities are clearly identified and recorded.  8.5.2 Add Corresponding Risk Responses to the Project Management Plan  While developing the detailed set of risk responses the projectrelated implications are evaluated for inclusion in a modified project management plan. These include costs resource assignments scheduling details and changes to project documentation. Until these changes are formally approved along with the additional risks that they may carry risk response planning cannot be considered complete.  8.5.3 Review and Document Predicted Exposure  Once the risk responses have been defined and integrated into the project management plan the individual and overall residual risks related to this plan are evaluated in order to determine whether additional response planning is required as shown in Figure 82. This evaluation should provide an estimate of both the expected postresponse situation and the potential improvement of the risk exposure assuming that the proposed responses are effective. The evaluation should be documented. 5  CHAPTER 9  MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS  The effectiveness of Project Risk Management depends upon the way the approved plans are carried out. These plans should be executed correctly reviewed and updated regularly. If this is carried out correctly the invested effort will be rewarded and future projects will benefit from this projects experience.  9.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Monitor and Control Risks Process  The primary objectives of risk monitoring and controlling are to track identified risks monitor residual risks identify new risks ensure that risk response plans are executed at the appropriate time and evaluate their effectiveness throughout the project life cycle.  In addition to tracking and managing the risk response actions the effectiveness of all of the Project Risk Management processes should be reviewed to provide improvements to the management of the current project as well as future ones.  For each risk or set of risks for which a contingent response has been defined the corresponding set of trigger conditions should have been specified. It is the responsibility of the action owner to ensure that these conditions are effectively monitored and that the corresponding actions are carried out as defined in a timely manner.  Once the Plan Risk Responses process is complete all of the approved unconditional response actions should have been included and defined in the current project management plan. The first action of risk monitoring and controlling is to check whether this is the case and take any appropriate action if necessary such as invoking the change management process with respect to any missing actions. This will then ensure that the agreedupon actions are carried out within the normal project execution framework.  The risk owners and risk action owners need to be briefed on any changes that may affect their responsibilities. Effective communication needs to be maintained between them and the project manager so that the designated stakeholders accept accountability for controlling the potential outcomes of specific risks apply their best efforts to track the associated trigger conditions and carry out the agreedupon responses in a timely manner.  In addition to the response actions and trigger conditions a mechanism for measuring the effectiveness of the response is provided by the Plan Risk Responses process. The risk action owner should keep the risk owner aware of the status of the response actions so that the risk owner can decide when the risk has been effectively dealt with or whether additional actions need to be planned and implemented. 5 CHAPTER 9  MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS As the project progresses additional information becomes available and the project environment may change as some risks occur whether foreseen or unforeseen and others become or cease to be relevant. The planning should therefore be kept current and the project manager should ensure that periodic risk reassessment including risk identification analysis and response planning is repeated at reasonable intervals or in response to project eventswithout generating excessive administrative overhead. Typical reasons for risk reassessment are  Occurrence of a major or unexpected risk   Need to analyze a complex change request   Phase end review   Project replanning or major plan elaboration and   Periodic review to ensure that the information remains current.   In the event of major organizational changes risk management planning may need to be revisited prior to reassessing the risks.  In addition to the regular status reviews periodic audits should be performed to determine strengths and weaknesses in handling risks within the project. This should entail identifying any barriers to effectiveness or keys to success in risk management recognition of which could lead to improvements in risk management of the current or future projects.  At the end of the project an integrated analysis of the risk management process should be carried out with a focus on longterm process improvements. This analysis consolidates the findings of the periodic audits to identify lessons that would be applicable in general to a large proportion of the organizations projects in the future such as appropriate levels of resources adequate time for the analysis use of tools level of detail etc.  At project closure the project manager should ensure that a description has been given of the closure of every risk in the risk register for example a did not occur b occurred and contingency plan invoked or c occurred and impact to the project scope i.e. time cost and quality.  The output of the audit of the risk management process should be consolidated with specific information with respect to the projects experience of risks and any generally applicable guidelines for the organization should be highlighted and potential actions proposed for applying them. This can lead to an update to the corresponding organizational process assets.  An overview of the steps involved in the Monitor and Control Risks process is given in Figure 91.  5 CHAPTER 9  MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS Figure 91. Schematic Representation of the Monitor and Control Risks Process   9.2 Critical Success Factors for the Monitor and Control Risks Process  Critical success factors relate to maintaining risk awareness throughout the project and include the characteristics and capabilities detailed in Sections 9.2.1 through 9.2.3.  9.2.1 Integrate Risk Monitoring and Control with Project Monitoring and Control  From the start the project management plan should include the actions required to monitor and control project risk. This should be set up early in the project planning cycle and then adjusted in view of the risk response planning decisions adding for example the actions associated with monitoring specific conditions or metrics. Once risk response planning has been carried out the project schedule should include all of the agreedupon responserelated actions so that they can be carried out as a normal part of project execution and tracked accordingly. 5 CHAPTER 9  MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS 9.2.2 Continuously Monitor Risk Trigger Conditions  Risk response planning will have defined a set of actions to be carried out as part of the project schedule as well as actions whose execution is dependent on a predefined trigger condition. Checking for specifically defined risks that may trigger conditional responses is the responsibility of the risk action owner in close collaboration with the risk owner under the overall authority of the project manager.  9.2.3 Maintain Risk Awareness  Risk management reports should be a regular item on every status meeting agenda to ensure that all team members remain aware of the importance of risk management and to ensure that it is fully integrated into all of the project management decisions.  The projects seniorlevel sponsor should require regular reports on the risks and the planned responses to ensure that stakeholders are aware of the importance of keeping a focus on risk. Sponsor feedback also motivates the project team by demonstrating seniorlevel interest in Project Risk Management.  Stakeholders perception of the effectiveness of risk management is conditioned in part by the way in which risks are handled as they occur and by the number or characteristics of such events. It is therefore crucial whenever a risk occurs that information about the event as well as the progress and effectiveness of the responses be communicated at regular intervals and in an honest manner adapted to the needs of each stakeholder. This should be supported by a wellexecuted communications plan.  9.3 Tools and Techniques for the Monitor and Control Risks Process  In addition to standard project management monitoring and control capabilities risk monitoring and controlling requires a focus on the tools which will support its key success factors for tracking overall risk as well as individual risks.  9.3.1 Managing Contingency Reserves  Reserves may have been allocated separately to cover timerelated and costrelated risks. Techniques are required that allow the project manager to assess at any point in the project whether these provide the required level of confidence in the success of the project.  Tools for managing time buffers should be closely integrated into the projects scheduling techniques whereas those for managing cost should be compatible with the financial practices. Tools are required to identify trends and forecast future outcomes to determine whether the reserves will remain sufficient. Tools are also required for tracking progress and spending in a consolidated manner. 5 CHAPTER 9  MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS 9.3.2 Tracking Trigger Conditions  Trigger conditions and the corresponding metrics are defined during the Plan Risk Responses process. Tools are required to evaluate and track these conditions against the project baseline or specified thresholds based on actual status. They can be chosen to provide information on risks related to the deliverables such as performance as well as on projectrelated features such as time and cost.  9.3.3 Tracking Overall Risk  Tools are required in order to determine as the project progresses whether the responses are having the expected effect on the projects overall level of risk.  9.3.4 Tracking Compliance  In order to monitor the quality of the execution of the riskrelated plans and processes a set of quality metrics such as degree of variation from the baseline should be tracked and recorded. These metrics will normally have been defined in the risk management plan.  9.4 Documenting the Results of the Monitor and Control Risks Process  The final control action of risk monitoring and controlling is to record actual data for future use. This includes all of the relevant information relating to risk management from start to finish of the project. The definition of what this information must include as well as the storage mechanism should have been previously specified in the risk management plan.  The goal is to ensure that the significant risk management information is recorded to provide concrete data to the lessons learned process for inclusion in a lessons learned document report or other communication vehicle. Typical information includes the following   For each identified risk or type of risk whether it occurred and if so when and how often. All  relevant data should be recorded impact effectiveness of detection and of response and any unplanned additional actions that were carried out.  Effectiveness of avoidance or exploitation actions.   Effectiveness of transfer and sharing actions.   Unexpected or undocumented risks which occurred and data about them.   Effectiveness of risk mitigation and enhancement actions.   Occurrence of accepted threats or opportunities.   Consolidated information should be provided on the level of effort expended. Costs and benefits to the project of risk management activities should also be provided.  This information will need to be archived and indexed in a manner that will facilitate retrieval for easy review during the project at closure and for future projects when the need arises.  57A  APPENDIX A  GUIDELINES FOR A PMI PRACTICE STANDARD  A.1  Introduction  A PMI practice standard is characterized as follows   Each practice standard provides guidelines on the mechanics e.g. nuts and bolts basics  fundamentals stepbystep usage guide how it operates how to do it of some significant process input tool technique or output that is relevant to a project manager.   A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the lifecycle phases of many projects however an  individual practice standard may be applicable to the completion of one or more phases within a project.   A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the Knowledge Areas within   A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge    PMBOK    Guide Fourth Edition although an individual practice standard will provide sufficient detail and background for one or more of the inputs tools and techniques andor outputs. Therefore practice standards are not required to use the name of any Knowledge Area.   Each practice standard should include information on what the significant process is and does  why it is significant how to perform it when it should be performed and if necessary for further clarification who should perform it.   Each practice standard should include information that is accepted and applicable for most projects  most of the time within the project management community. Processes that are generally restricted or applicable to one industry country or companion profession i.e. an  application area  may be included as an appendix for informational purposes rather than as part of the practice standard. With strong support and evidence an application areaspecific process may be considered as an extension practice standard in the same manner as extensions to the  PMBOK    Guide Fourth Edition are considered.   Each practice standard will benefit from the inclusion of examples and templates. It is best when an  example or template includes a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses. A background description may be necessary to put this discussion in the appropriate context. The examples should be aligned with the relevant information in the standard or its appendix and placed in proximity to that information.  All practice standards shall be written in the same general style and format.    E ach practice standard project will be aligned with or reference other practice standards as needed.   Each practice standard will be consistent with the   PMBOK    Guide Fourth Edition.   Each practice standard is intended to be more prescriptive than the   PMBOK    Guide Fourth Edition.  59B  APPENDIX B  EVOLUTION OF PMIS PRACTICE STANDARD FOR PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT  B.1 PreProject  In early 2005 PMI began exploration for developing the first Practice Standard for Project Risk Management. Focus would be placed on single project risk management for a single project rather than including programs or portfolios of projects with close coupling to the Project Risk Management section of  A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge   PMBOK    Guide   Third Edition. By April 20 2006 the PMI Standards Members Advisory Group MAG approved the following final charter for the standard with Cynthia A. Berg PMP  as the Project Manager and Dr. David Hulett as the Deputy Project Manager. The charter included the following characteristics for the standard   Provides information on Project Risk Management that includes information that is clear complete  relevant and generally recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time.   Is consistent with the   PMBOK    Guide   Third Edition expanding but not contradicting the concepts and techniques related to Project Risk Management and keeps within the limits and practices of Project Risk Management as described within Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK    Guide  Third Edition.   Has been reviewed and updated by the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management  Project Team.   Is written for project management practitioners and other stakeholders of the project management  profession.  Describes the processes that are unique to Project Risk Management.    Includes in an appendix examples and templates of specific Project Risk Management processes  tools andor techniques addressed in the practice standard with discussions of their strengths and weaknesses including background descriptions that put the relative strengths and weaknesses into context.   Uses the   PMBOK    Guide   Third Edition Glossary as the starting point of its glossary and does not contain contradictions.  Uses a glossary term in the text without definition or additional explanation.   Is aligned with and does not contradict other PMI standards.    Follows the PMI Style Guide is written in North American English translatable to PMI official  languages and is sensitive to cultural issues. 60B APPENDIX B  Can be approved as a PMI standard which means that in addition to the content being acceptable  the process for selecting team members and soliciting and responding to comments on the product must be open and inclusive.  B.2 Preliminary Work  In recognition that risk management is not practiced well on many projects the project team set out to identify practices that are viewed as best practices as those are understood and applied in most successfully managed projects most of the time.  The project core team was initially formed in the fall of 2005 and consisted of Dr. David Hillson PMP  Kik Piney and Kris Persun.  B.3 Scope Changes  During the time the project was chartered the  PMBOK    Guide   Fourth Edition was commissioned. As a result the charter of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management was expanded to be consistent and noncontradictory with that standard.  B.4 Exposure and Consensus  The standard was submitted as an exposure draft in the winter of 2007 and exposed on 23 March 2008. There were 849 comments. The teams comment acceptance rate comments accepted outright and accepted with modifications was 57. The PMI Standards Manager submitted the resultant final draft with the concurrence of the PMI Standards  Program MAG to the PMI Standards Program Consensus Body for official ballot on 27 March 2009 . Twentyeight members of the PMI Standards Program Consensus Body agreed to participate in the ballot of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management.  Those not participating included the PM and Deputy PM for this standard because their participation was considered a con  ict of interest. The balloting period was closed on 25 April 2009 with 23 ballots returned. Consensus Body voting results were as follows 22 affirmative and 1 affirmative with comment. The affirmative with comment pertained to future revisions of the standard and possible improvements to the comment adjudication process.61C  APPENDIX C  CONTRIBUTORS AND REVIEWERS OF THE  PRACTICE STANDARD FOR PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT   This appendix lists alphabetically within groupings those individuals who have contributed to the development and production of the  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management .

The most commonly used of these are listed in the following tables along with their strengths weaknesses and critical success factors. Where a technique can be used in more than one Project Risk Management process it is described in detail in the section associated with the main process that it supports and referred to as necessary for other processes to which it can be of use. Examples and templates shown after each table provide illustrations of the most common and good practice uses of these tools and techniques. This information is not intended to explain the tools and techniques but to list them with certain important characteristics. Those who are interested in learning more are encouraged to seek other sources such as handbooks textbooks or courses in project risk management.  D.1  Techniques Examples and Templates for Risk Management Planning Chapter 4  Plan Risk Management defines the approach to be followed for managing the risks throughout the lifespan of the corresponding project.  D.1.1 Techniques  An example of an approach is given in Table D1.     Table D1.

Introduction   Project Description   Project objectives   External dependencies   Stakeholder analysis   Risk Management Scope and Objectives   Variance thresholds   Prioritization of project objectives   Thresholds weights and other parameters    Definition of criteria for unacceptable threats and unmissable opportunities    Impact scales probability scales PxI matrices weighting of project objectives prioritization and selection criteria degree of confidence required for overall risk e.g. 80 th  percentile from quantitative risk analysis  Risk Management Methodology   Relationship with the organizational environment   Risk management activities    Link to the project management methodology   Relationship with other project management processes  Risk taxonomyrisk breakdown structure either generic or projectspecific   Format of a fully defined risk statement description metalanguage   Key deliverables   Risk Management Organization   Roles responsibilities and levels of authority for risk management    Rules of escalation  Budgeting for risk management activities added to the project budget    Adapted to the complexity and sensitivity of the project   Scheduling of risk management activities in the project schedule i.e. when certain actions  or reviews need to be carried out frequency life cycle related etc. 71D APPENDIX D Reporting    Governancerelated rules of reporting and disclosure  Use of Tools   Tool name description usage   Structure of the risk database    Requirements in terms of system resources  Communications Planning   Documents usage rules for distribution frequency audience etc.   Document templates    Risk register   Risk status reports  D.1.1.2 Templates Relevant to Risk Management Planning  The risk management plan should provide a number of templates for use by the other processes. These may include  Formal structure for a risk statement   An example is given below   Means of categorizing risks for example a risk breakdown structure   An example is given in the Identify Risks section of this appendix   Definitions by project objective of probability and impact scales   An example is given in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis section of this appendix   Risk prioritization and selection guidelines    These guidelines may be used in Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis and in Perform Quantitative  Risk Analysis as well as in Plan Risk Response Planning. An example is given below.  Status report templates   Typical agenda for status meetings   D.1.1.3 Risk Statement Metalanguage  In order for all risks to be clearly defined a standard structure for the way in which the risk is described should be specified and applied. A typical such statement is    Because of one or more causes risk might occur which would lead to one or more effects. 72D APPENDIX D D.1.1.4 Risk Prioritization and Selection Guidelines  The selection and prioritization of risks must be linked to the project objectives. The risk management plan will define the relative importance to be assigned to these objectives e.g. reliability takes precedence over time etc. this may be in the form of numerical weights that can be applied to create a single weighted sum over all objectives for each risk. Any other features that may affect the urgency of dealing with a risk should also be specified e.g. one linked to a resource that will soon disappear should be given greater urgency.    D.2 Techniques Examples and Templates for Identify Risks Chapter 5  Identify Risks is carried out in order to develop a comprehensive list of all knowable uncertainties that could have an effect on the projects objectives.

D.2.1.1 Assumptions and Constraints Analysis  This technique requires three steps  1. List assumptions and constraints for the project  2. Test assumptions and constraints by asking two questions  a. Could the assumptionconstraint be false  b. If it were false would one or more project objectives be affected positively or negatively  3.  Where both questions are answered Yes generate a risk for example in the form Assumptionconstraint may prove false leading to effect on objectives.  The results can be documented in table form as shown in Figure D1.     Table D2. Identify Risks continued  77D APPENDIX D   Figure D1. Example of a Constraint Analysis with Fields for Description and Analysis Results    D.2.1.2 Brainstorming  Brainstorming is commonly used in a facilitated risk identification workshop to identify risks. The standard rules of brainstorming are often modified when the technique is applied to risk identification. For example it is common to structure the risk identification brainstorm using risk categories or a risk breakdown structure. Some evaluation of proposed risks is often included in a risk identification brainstorm to remove nonrisks. It is important to ensure active participation of relevant stakeholders in a risk identification brainstorm and for the facilitator to manage group dynamics carefully. No templates or examples are presented in this appendix.    D.2.1.3 Cause and Effect Ishikawa Diagrams  This technique presents in diagrammatic form the causes which contribute to a given outcome. Each main cause can be split further into subcauses. To use this technique for risk identification the outcome should be stated as an effect on a project objective i.e. the impact of a risk. The diagram then identifies risks as those uncertain events which could result in occurrence of the impact. Care needs to be taken when using this technique for risk identification to distinguish between risks uncertain causes of the impact and issues certain causes of the impact. An example cause and effect Ishikawa diagram is shown below the risk effect to be analyzed is staff leaving the project the main causes are Environment Ambition Career Prospects Satisfaction Remuneration.    Figure D2. Example of a Cause and Effect or Ishikawa Diagram for Staff Leaving  78D APPENDIX D  D.2.1.4 Checklists  Checklists are compiled to capture previous project experience and allow it to be used for subsequent similar projects. It is possible to structure the risk identification checklist around a risk breakdown structure as shown in the partial example below. It is useful to present the checklist as a set of risks each of which is considered in turn to determine whether it might be relevant to the project under consideration. Risk identification checklists should include both threats and opportunities.   .   Figure D3. Example Fragment of a Checklist with Typical Structure of Category Subcategory Specific Risks and Effect    D.2.1.5 Delphi Technique  The Delphi technique uses a facilitated anonymous polling of subject matter experts to identify risks in their area of expertise. The facilitator gathers the experts initial responses and circulates them without attribution to the group who may revise their contributions based on those of others. The process often generates a consensus of the experts in a few iterations. No templates or examples are presented.  D.2.1.6 Document Review  Risks can be identified through careful review of project documentation including the project charter statement of work contract terms and conditions subcontracts technical specifications regulatory requirements legal stipulations etc where relevant. Formal structured methods of document review can be used such as the Fagan Inspection Process or a more informal approach may be adopted. No templates or examples are presented.  D.2.1.7 FMEAFault Tree Analysis  Failure Modes and Effects Analysis FMEA or Fault Tree Analysis is the analysis of a model structured to identify the various elements that can cause system failure by themselves or in combination with others 79D APPENDIX Dbased on the logic of the system. Fault tree analysis is typically used in engineering contexts. It can be adapted for use to identify risks by analyzing how risk impacts might arise. Another result is the probability of failure or of reliability mean time between failure etc. of the overall system indicating the level of quality of the system or product. If the level of reliability is not acceptable the Fault Tree can indicate where the system can be made more reliabletherefore it is useful in the design and engineering phase of the project. An example is shown below.    Figure D4. Fault Tree Analysis of the Possible Causes of a Crash at the Main Road Junction    this will be changed to be more projectoriented    D.2.1.8 Force Field Analysis  Force Field Analysis is typically used in the change management context. It can be adapted for risk identification by identifying driving forces forces for change and restraining forces forces against change which currently affect achievement of a project objective. Risks can then be identified as uncertain events or conditions which would lead to a change in the strength of one or more of the identified forces. An example force field diagram is shown below. 80D APPENDIX D   Figure D5. Example of a Force Field Analysis and the Balance of Forces For and Against Change    D.2.1.9 Industry Knowledge Base  An industry knowledge base is a special case of a checklist see above and is used similarly. No templates or examples are presented.  D.2.1.10 In  uence Diagrams  An in  uence diagram is a diagrammatic representation of a project situation showing the main entities decision points uncertainties and outcomes and indicating the relationships in  uences between them. The in  uence diagram can identify risks when combined with sensitivity analysis or Monte Carlo simulation to reveal sources of risk within the project. An example is shown below. 81D APPENDIX D   Figure D6. Example of an Influence Diagram in a Bidding Situation    D.2.1.11 Interviews  Risk identification interviews should include all main stakeholders and be conducted by an independent skilled interviewer using a structured agenda in an atmosphere of confidentiality honesty and mutual trust. A risk breakdown structure checklist or prompt list can be used as a framework for risk interviews. No templates or examples are presented.  D.2.1.12 Nominal Group Technique  The Nominal Group Technique is an adaptation of brainstorming where participants share and discuss all issues before evaluation with each participant participating equally in evaluation. No templates or examples are presented.  D.2.1.13 PostProject ReviewsLessons LearnedHistorical Information  Information relevant to risks for a current project can be obtained by reviewing databases of risks which occurred in previous similar situations. Such databases might arise from postproject reviews or lessons learned exercises. They may also exist as repositories of historical information either within an organization or industry body. No templates or examples are presented. 82D APPENDIX D D.2.1.14 Prompt Lists  A prompt list is a set of risk categories which can be used to stimulate risk identification. The prompt list may be presented as a risk breakdown structure see below or as a set of headings. A number of standard prompt lists have been developed for use in risk identification and some of these are presented below. These can then be used as a framework for other risk identification techniques such as brainstorming see D.2.1.2 or risk interviews see D2.1.11.  1. The PESTLE prompt list  Political   Economic   Social   Technological   Legal   Environmental   2. The TECOP prompt list  Technical   Environmental   Commercial   Operational   Political   3. The SPECTRUM prompt list  Sociocultural   Political   Economic   Competitive   Technology   Regulatorylegal   Uncertaintyrisk   Market   D.2.1.15 Questionnaire  A risk identification questionnaire can be presented as a special form of checklist see D.2.1.4 where possible risks are shown in question format for example Is the clients requirement clearly defined rather 83D APPENDIX Dthan as risk statements The client may change the requirement after project start.. Alternatively a risk identification questionnaire can be used to present the headings from a prompt list see D.2.1.14 asking questions such as Are there any uncertainties arising from the use of technology on this project No templates or examples are presented.  D.2.1.16 Risk Breakdown Structure RBS  The risk breakdown structure RBS is a hierarchical framework of potential sources of risk to a project. An organization may develop a generic RBS for use across all its projects or a project may use a projectspecific RBS. A partial example RBS is shown below.    Figure D7. Example of a Generic Risk Breakdown Structure  84D APPENDIX D  D.2.1.17 RootCause Analysis  A root cause analysis seeks to identify basic causes of risks that may be visible symptoms of more fundamental forces. It may also identify common sources of several risks leading to broadreaching risk response strategies. Similarly care needs to be taken when using this technique for risk identification to distinguish between risks uncertain causes of the impact and issues certain causes of the impact. In the diagram shown below the risks that were initially identified included rework extra cost schedule slips low team morale customer mistrust and repeated audits. An examination of the identified risks lead to a common root cause that later phases of the project were typically started before the earlier ones were sufficiently mature. This organization repeatedly ignored the proper phase entry prerequisites hastening later project stages in order to speed up the project.    Figure D8. Example of a Root Cause Analysis    D.2.1.18 SWOT Analysis  SWOT Analysis identifies four characteristics of a given situation strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats. The technique is commonly used in strategic decision making. It can be adapted for risk identification by changing the interpretation of the four perspectives such that strengths and weaknesses relate to the characteristics of the organization conducting the project and opportunities and threats identify the project risks. The technique is particularly useful for identifying internallygenerated risks arising from within the organization. For example opportunities might be found by leveraging organizational strengths or threats might arise as a result of organizational weaknesses as illustrated below. 85D APPENDIX D   Figure D9. Example of a SWOT Analysis Structure    D.2.1.19 System Dynamics  System dynamics SD is a particular application of in  uence diagrams see above and can be used to identify risks within a project situation. The SD model represents entities and information   ows within a project and analysis of the model can reveal feedback and feedforward loops which lead to uncertainty or instability. In addition the results of an SD analysis can show the impact of risk events on overall project results such as the cost or schedule results to be expected. Analyses of changes in the model or assumptions can indicate the systems sensitivity to specific events some of which may be risks. A simple example of an SD diagram is shown in Figure D11.   Figure D10. Example of a Simple System Dynamics Model with Feedback Loops  86D APPENDIX D D.2.1.20 WBS Review  The work breakdown structure WBS for a project can form a framework for a number of other risk identification techniques such as brainstorming risk interviews checklists or prompt lists. No templates or examples are presented.  D.3  Techniques Examples and Templates for Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Chapter 6  Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis prioritizes for further analysis or handling the undifferentiated list of risks that have been identified in the Identify Risks process. Organizations tend to apply resources to those designated as high risk based on their priority often indicated by the risks probability and impact characteristics.  D.3.1 Techniques for Perform Qualtitative Risk Analysis  Example of approaches are given in Table D3 and D.3.1.1 through D.3.1.3.    Table D3.

One common way is to assign levels of risk probability by ranges of probability. One benefit of this approach is that the subject matter experts only need to assess a risks probability within a range rather than as a specific value. An example assuming that a 55 Probability and Impact Matrix is desired is shown in Figure D11 where the probability ranges are more tightly defined at low levels of probability.  Examples of impact level definitions are very projectspecific. The values used to specify the level of impact from very low to very high if a 55 matrix is being used should be   Higher impact for threats or opportunities as they move from very low to very high for a specific  objective   Levels are defined by the organization as causing the same amount of pain or gain to the project for  each level across objectives   If a risks possible impact is uncertain and could be assigned to more than one level of impact e.g.  from moderate to high the analyst may choose to assign the risk to the impact level that represents the expected or average impact. Alternatively the risk may be   agged for extra analysis in order to reduce the range of uncertainty to fit within a single range.  An example of impact level definitions is shown in Figure D11. These definitions should be tailored or scaled by stakeholders to the specific project. The definitions appropriately tailored to the project can be used for opportunities and threats.  Table D3.

Example of Definitions for Levels of Probability and Impact on Four Specific Objectives Used to Evaluate Individual Risks.   NoteOpportunities are to be treated as representing a positive saving in time or cost or increased functionality. For threats each impact scale is interpreted negatively i.e. time delays increased cost or reduced functionality.    D.3.1.2 Probability and Impact Matrix  Organizations typically assess a risks priority on an objective from the combination of probability of occurrence and impact on that project objective using definitions such as those shown in Figure D11. Risks are then placed on a probability and impact PI matrix such as one shown below. This matrix includes both threats and opportunities.    Figure D12. Example of ProbabilityImpact Matrix Used to Sort Risks Threats and Opportunities into High Risk H Moderate Risk M and Low Risk L Classes  90D APPENDIX D    D.3.1.3 Analytic Hierarchy Process AHP  AHP is a method to calibrate preferences for achieving the different objectives of a project. Do they prefer to achieve time more than cost Is quality more important than scope What is the relative weighting of the projects objectives in terms of their priority to the stakeholders or to management The results are weights summing to 100 that re  ect the relative priority of each objective. This prioritization can be important in determining how tradeoffs affecting different objectives e.g. Should we reduce scope to finish on time will be decided. It can also be used to create an overall project risk priority list from risks that have been assessed on their implications for individual objectives. Specialized software implementing AHP is available. A spreadsheet implementation is shown below.    Figure D13. Example of Analytic Hierarchy Process Computations to Determine the Relative Weighting of Four Project Objectives  91D APPENDIX D  D.4  Techniques Examples and Templates for Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis Chapter 7  Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis seeks to determine the overall risk to project objectives when all risks potentially operate simultaneously on the project. It provides answers to several questions   How likely is the project to complete on the schedule date or earlier How likely is the project actual cost  to be the budgeted cost or less How reliable will the product be that the project produces What is the best decision to make in the face of uncertain results   How much contingency in time and cost is needed to provide the organization with its desired degree of  confidence in the results How should the design of the product or system be changed most economically to increase its reliability  What are the individual risks that seem to be the most important in determining the overall project risk   D.4.1 Techniques for Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis  Examples of techniques for Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis are found shown in Table D4 and details are given in D.4.1.1 through D.4.1.5  Technique  Strengths  Weaknesses  CSFs For effective application   Decision Tree Analysis   Causes the  organization to structure the costs and benefits of decisions when the results are determined in part by uncertainty and risk  Solution of the  decision tree helps select the decision that provides the highest Expected Monetary Value or expected utility to the organization  It is sometimes  difficult to create the decision structure  Probabilities of  occurrences can be difficult to quantify in the absence of historical data The best decision may  change with relatively plausible changes in the input data meaning that the answer may not be stableThe organization may  not make decisions based on a linear Expected Monetary Value basis but rather on a nonlinear utility function utility functions are difficult to specify Careful structuring of  the decision tree.

The software allows the user to specify the structure of the decision with decision nodes chance nodes costs benefits and probabilities. The user can also evaluate the different decisions using linear utility functions based on Expected Monetary Value or on nonlinear utility functions of various shapes. An example is shown below where  The negative numbers represent out  ows or investments e.g. COTS   The percentages represent probabilities of the event occurring e.g. Major Problems   The positive numbers represent rewards or values e.g. after Fix the Problem    True indicates the decision option taken from the square decision node whereas false  indicates the decision option not taken    Figure D14. Example of a Decision Tree for Choosing between an Experimental Technology vs. Commercial Off the Shelf COTS TechnologySource Precision Tree from Palisade Corporation    D.4.1.2 Expected Monetary Value  Expected Monetary Value EMV is a simple calculation of a value such as weighted average or expected cost or benefit when the outcomes are uncertain. All reasonable alternative outcomes are identified. Their probabilities of occurring summing to 100 and their values are estimated. The EMV calculation is made for the entire event by weighting the individual possible outcomes by their probabilities of occurring as shown in Figure D15.      D.4.1.3 Monte Carlo Simulation  Monte Carlo simulation is a detailed computerintensive simulation approach to determining the value and probability of possible outcomes of a project objective such as a project schedule e.g. the completion date or cost estimate e.g. the total cost. It computes the schedule or cost estimate many times using inputs drawn at 95D APPENDIX Drandom from ranges specified with probability distribution functions for schedule activity durations or cost lineitems. The solutions using these different input values are used to build a histogram of possible project outcomes and their relative probability and cumulative probability from which to compute desired contingency reserves of time or cost. Additional results include the relative importance of each input in determining the overall project cost and schedule. Examples of the output of schedule and cost risk results are shown in Figures D16 and D17.  D.4.1.4 Monte Carlo Analysis of Finish Dates in Quantitative Schedule Risk Analysis    Figure D16.

The corresponding plan with the supporting information should then be documented and approved at project management or sponsor level. This approval must include authorization to deploy the corresponding resources if the predefined trigger conditions arise. No templates or examples are presented.  D.5.1.2 Contingency Reserve Estimation  All of the conditional response plans as well any of the residual risks will if they occur have an effect on the schedule andor budget andor performance objectives of the project. An amount time and cost needs to be set aside to allow for these eventualities. This amount is made up of two components those to cover specific approved conditional responses e.g. contingency plans and those to address unspecified or passively accepted risks. Quantitative methods see chapter 7 can be used to determine the amounts that should be set aside e.g. decision trees for conditional responses simulation for the set of unspecified risks. These reserves are tracked and managed in Monitor and Control Risks chapter 9. No templates or examples are presented.  D.5.1.3 MultiCriteria Selection Techniques  This is an adaptation of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process chapter 6 based on selection criteria. The example below shows the use of a spreadsheet to calculate the weighted scores of two options based on a predefined set of prioritized criteria points is the product of weight by rating.    Figure D18. Example of Comparing Options by their Ratings Along Four Prioritized Criteria    D.5.1.4 Scenario Analysis  Scenario analysis for risk response planning involves defining several plausible alternative scenarios e.g. no change and all goes to plan disaster occurs utopia etc. The different scenarios may require different risk responses that can be described and evaluated for their cost and effectiveness. If the organization can choose between scenarios the alternatives including the responses can be compared. If the scenarios are out of the control of the organization the scenario analysis can lead to effective and necessary contingency planning. 101D APPENDIX D No template is offered for this technique.

Tracking the state of the reserve through project execution will provide summary information as to the evolution of the status of the corresponding risks. This information can be useful when reporting up the organization to those responsible for several projects. In addition once a corresponding risk occurs or ceases to be current i.e. when it can no longer impact the project the corresponding reserve needs to be reviewed in order to assess whether it still provides the agreed level of confidence.  Time buffers can be used in two different ways  To provide for accepted schedule risks as described above or   As a schedulingrelated technique in critical chain project management CCPM.   In contrast with the contingency reserve for identified risks the buffers in CCPM provide a shared mechanism for accommodating the natural variability of activity durations over a sequence or chain of activities. Tracking the rate at which each such buffer is used during project execution provides valuable information at a given point in time as to the level of schedule risk along that chain and is used in CCPM for adapting the priority or management focus for additional analysis and as necessary triggering further risk management activities.

D.6.1.5 Trend Analysis  The evolution of the variance values over time should be analyzed in order to evaluate how the risk profile is changing whether previous actions are having the expected effect and whether additional actions are required. The Earned Value formulae of the to complete performance index can be used to assess changes with respect to time and cost. No templates or examples are presented.  D.6.1.6 Variance Analysis  The formulae in Earned Value Analysis CV SV CPI SPI can be used to set thresholds for action and to indicate when the risk process may be ineffective. Earned value management systems EVMS use variance from plan as the basis of forecasts or extrapolations to the cost at completion. Projections made using EVMS have been shown by experience to be reliable early in the project e.g. 20 into the execution.

Assumptions are factors that for planning purposes are considered to be true real or certain without proof or demonstration. Assumptions affect all aspects of project planning and are part of the progressive elaboration of the project. Project teams frequently identify document and validate assumptions as part of their planning process. Assumptions generally involve a degree of risk.   Benefit.  Positive effect on a project objective arising from the occurrence of an opportunity.   Bias.  During information gathering about risk the source of information exhibits a preference or an inclination that inhibits impartial judgment. Types of bias which commonly affect the risk process include cognitive and motivational bias.   Cause.  Events or circumstances which currently exist and which might give rise to risks.   Consequence.  See  impact .   Constraint.  The state quality or sense of being restricted to a given course of action or inaction. An applicable restriction or limitation either internal or external to a project which will affect the performance of the project or a process.   Contingency Reserve.  The amount of funds budget or time needed above the estimate to reduce the risk of overruns of project objectives to a level acceptable to the organization.   Contingency Plan.  A plan developed in anticipation of the occurrence of a risk to be executed only if specific predetermined trigger conditions arise.   Decision Tree Analysis.  The decision tree is a diagram that describes a decision under consideration and the implications of choosing one or another of the available alternatives. It is used when some future scenarios or outcomes of actions are uncertain. It incorporates probabilities and the cost or rewards of each logical path of events and future decisions and uses expected monetary value analysis to help the organization identify the relative values of alternative actions.   Effect.  Conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project objectives if the associated risk happened.   Emergent Risk.  A risk which arises later in a project and which could not have been identified earlier on.   Identify Risks.  The process of determining which risks may affect the project and documenting their characteristics.   Impact.  A measure of the effect of a risk on one or more objectives if it occurs. Also known as  consequence . 110GLOSSARY  Individual Risk.  A specific uncertain event or condition which if it occurs has a positive or negative effect on at least one project objective.   Issue.  See  problem .   Likelihood.  See  probability .   Monitor and Control Risks.  The process of implementing risk response plans tracking identified risks monitoring residual risks identifying new risks and evaluating the risk process throughout the project life cycle.   Monte Carlo Analysis.  A technique that computes or iterates the project cost or project schedule many times using input values selected at random from probability distributions of possible costs or durations to calculate a distribution of possible total project cost or completion dates.   Objective.  Something toward which work is to be directed a strategic position to be attained or a purpose to be achieved a result to be obtained a product to be produced or a service to be performed.   Opportunity.  A condition or situation favorable to the project a positive set of circumstances a positive set of events a risk that will have a positive impact on project objectives or a possibility for positive changes. Contrast with  threat .   Overall Project Risk.  Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall project risk is more than the sum of individual risks on a project since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual elements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome measured in terms of the corresponding objectives.   Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis.  The process of prioritizing risks for further analysis or action by assessing and combining their probability of occurrence and impact.   Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis.  The process of numerically analyzing the effect of identified risks on overall project objectives.   Plan Risk Management.  The process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project.   Plan Risk Responses.  The process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and to reduce threats to project objectives.   Probability.  A measure of how likely an individual risk is to occur. Also known as  likelihood .   Problem.  Negative effect on a project objective arising from occurrence of a threat.   Project Risk Management.  Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting risk management planning identification analysis responses and monitoring and control on a project. The purpose of Project Risk Management is to increase the probability and impact of positive events and decrease the probability and impact of events adverse to project objectives. 111GLOSSARY  Response Strategy.  A highlevel approach to address an individual risk or overall project risk broken down into a set of risk actions.   Risk.  An uncertain event or condition that if it occurs has a positive or negative effect on a projects objectives.   Risk Action.  A detailed task which implements in whole or in part a response strategy in order to address an individual risk or overall project risk.   Risk Action Owner.  The person responsible for carrying out the approved risk actions for responding to a given risk. Also known as response owner when the context allows it.   Risk Attitude.  A chosen mental disposition towards uncertainty adopted explicitly or implicitly by individuals and groups driven by perception and evidenced by observable behavior. Risk attitude exists on a continuous spectrum but common risk attitudes include risk averse risk tolerant risk neutral and risk seeking.   Risk Breakdown Structure RBS  Tool A hierarchically organized depiction of the identified project risks arranged by risk category and subcategory that identifies the various areas and causes of potential risks. The risk breakdown structure is often tailored to specific project types.   Risk Category.   A group of potential causes of risk. Risk causes may be grouped into categories such as technical external organizational environmental or project management. A category may include subcategories such as technical maturity weather or aggressive estimating. See also  Risk Breakdown Structure RBS    Risk Exposure.  A measure of overall project risk describing the overall effect of identified risks on objectives.   Risk Management Plan.  The document describing how Project Risk Management will be structured and performed on the project. It is contained in or is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan. The risk management plan can be informal and broadly framed or formal and highly detailed based on the needs of the project. Information in the risk management plan varies by application area and project size. The risk management plan is different from the risk register that contains the list of project risks the results of risk analysis and the risk responses.   Risk Metalanguage.  A structured description of a risk which separates cause risk and effect. A typical risk description using risk metalanguage might be in the form Because of cause risk might occur which would lead to effect.   Risk Model.  A representation of the project including data about project elements and risks that can be analyzed by quantitative methods.   Risk Owner . The person responsible for ensuring that an appropriate response strategy is selected and implemented and for determining suitable risk actions to implement the chosen strategy with each risk action assigned to a single risk action owner. \n"

There is extensive literature about lean management, just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing, Kaizen, total productive maintenance (TPM), theory of constraints (TOC), and other methods.

The increase in using agile approaches mainly for the execution of IT projects has given rise to the self-organizing team, where the team functions with an absence of centralized control. In projects that have self-organizing teams, the project manager (who may not be called a project manager) role provides the team with the environment and support needed and trusts the team to get the job done.

The matrix format shows all activities associated with one person and all people associated with one activity.

The assigned resources can be shown as individuals or groups. The project manager can select other options, such as “lead” and “resource” designations, as appropriate for the project.

      "deliverables having the same functional use but different technical characteristics. The project manager and the project management team are responsible for managing the trade-offs associated with delivering the required levels of both quality and grade. While a quality level that fails to meet quality requirements is always a problem, a low-grade product may not be a problem. For example:\n",
      "uuIt may not be a problem if a suitable low-grade product (one with a limited number of features) is of high quality (no obvious defects). In this example, the product would be appropriate for its general purpose of use.\n",
      "uuIt may be a problem if a high-grade product (one with numerous features) is of low quality (many defects). In essence, a high-grade feature set would prove ineffective and/or inefﬁcient due to low quality.\n",
      "Prevention is preferred over inspection. It is better to design quality into deliverables, rather than to ﬁnd quality issues \n",
      "during inspection. The cost of preventing mistakes is generally much less than the cost of correcting mistakes when they are found by inspection or during usage.\n",
      "Depending on the project and the industry area, the project team may need a working knowledge of statistical control \n",
      "processes to evaluate data contained in the Control Quality outputs. The team should know the differences between the following pairs of terms:\n",
      "uuPrevention (keeping errors out of the process) and inspection (keeping errors out of the hands of the customer);\n",

Failure costs are often categorized into internal (found by the project team) and external (found by the customer). Failure costs are also called the cost of poor quality. Section 8.1.2.3 provides some examples to consider in each area. Organizations choose to invest in defect prevention because of the beneﬁts over the life of the product. Because projects are temporary, decisions about the COQ over a product’s life cycle are often the concern of program management, portfolio management, the PMO, or operations.\n",

      "uuDetect and correct the defects before the deliverables are sent to the customer as part of the quality control process. The control quality process has related costs, which are mainly the appraisal costs and internal failure costs.\n",

      "uuCustomer satisfaction. Understand, evaluate, deﬁne, and manage requirements so that customer expectations are met.

In agile environments, stakeholder engagement with the team ensures customer satisfaction is maintained throughout the project.\n",
      "uuContinual improvement. The plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle is the basis for quality improvement as deﬁned by Shewhart and modiﬁed by Deming. In addition, quality improvement initiatives such as total quality management (TQM), Six Sigma, and Lean Six Sigma may improve both the quality of project management, as well as the quality of the end product, service, or result.\n",

Relationships based on partnership and cooperation with the supplier are more beneﬁcial to the organization and to the suppliers than traditional supplier management.

      "Team resources or personnel refer to the human resources. Personnel may have varied skill sets, may be assigned full- or part-time, and may be added or removed from the project team as the project progresses. There is some overlap between Project Resource Management and Project Stakeholder Management (Section 13). This section (Section 9) focuses on the subset of stakeholders who make up the project team.\n",
      "KEY C ONCEPTS FOR P ROJECT R ESOU RCE M ANAGEMENT\n",
      "The project team consists of individuals with assigned roles and responsibilities who work collectively to achieve \n",
      "a shared project goal. The project manager should invest suitable effort in acquiring, managing, motivating, and \n",
      "empowering the project team. Although speciﬁc roles and responsibilities for the project team members are assigned, the involvement of all team members in project planning and decision making is beneﬁcial. Participation of team members during planning adds their expertise to the process and strengthens their commitment to the project.\n",
      "The project manager should be both leader and manager of the project team. In addition to project management \n",
      "activities such as initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing the various project phases, the project manager is responsible for the team formation as an effective group. The project manager should be aware of different aspects that inﬂuence the team, such as:\n",
      "uuTeam environment,\n",
      "uuGeographical locations of team members,\n",
      "uuCommunications among stakeholders,\n",
      "uuOrganizational change management,\n",
      "uuInternal and external politics,\n",
      "uuCultural issues and organizational uniqueness, and\n",
      "uuOther factors that may alter project performance.\n",
      "As a leader, the project manager is also responsible for proactively developing team skills and competencies while \n",
      "retaining and improving team satisfaction and motivation. The project manager should be aware of, and subscribe to, professional and ethical behavior, and ensure that all team members adhere to these behaviors.\n",
      "Physical resource management is concentrated in allocating and using the physical resources (material, equipment, \n",
      "and supplies, for example) needed for successful completion of the project in an efﬁcient and effective way. In order to do \n",
      "that, organizations should have data on resource demands (now and in the reasonable future), resource conﬁgurations that will be required to meet those demands, and the supply of resources. Failing to manage and control resources efﬁciently is a source of risk for successful project completion. For example:\n",
      "uuFailing to secure critical equipment or infrastructure on time may result in delays in the manufacturing of the ﬁnal product,\n",
      "uuOrdering low-quality material may damage the quality of the product causing a high rate of recalls or rework, and\n",
      "uuKeeping too much inventory may result in high operations costs and reduce the organization’s proﬁt. Unacceptably low inventory level, on the other hand, may result in not satisfying customer demand and, again, reduce the organization’s proﬁt.\n",
      "TRENDS AND E MERGI NG P RACTI CES I N PROJECT R ESOU RCE M ANAGEMENT\n",
      "Project management styles are shifting away from a command and control structure for managing projects and \n",
      "toward a more collaborative and supportive management approach that empowers teams by delegating decision making to the team members. In addition, modern project resource management approaches seek to optimize resource utilization. Trends and emerging practices for Project Resource Management include but are not limited to:\n",
      "uuResource management methods. Due to the scarce nature of critical resources, in some industries, several trends have become popular in the past several years. There is extensive literature about lean management, just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing, Kaizen, total productive maintenance (TPM), theory of constraints (TOC), and other methods. A project manager should determine if the performing organization has adopted one or more resource management tools and adapt the project accordingly.\n",
      "uuEmotional intelligence (EI). The project manager should invest in personal EI by improving inbound (e.g., \n",
      "self-management and self-awareness) and outbound (e.g., relationship management) competencies. Research suggests that project teams that succeed in developing team EI or become an emotionally competent group are more effective. Additionally, there is a reduction in staff turnover.\n",
      "uuSelf-organizing teams. The increase in using agile approaches mainly for the execution of IT projects has given rise to the self-organizing team, where the team functions with an absence of centralized control. In projects that have self-organizing teams, the project manager (who may not be called a project manager) role provides the team with the environment and support needed and trusts the team to get the job done. Successful self-organizing teams usually consist of generalized specialists, instead of subject matter experts, who continuously adapt to the changing environment and embrace constructive feedback.\n",
      "311uuVirtual teams/distributed teams. The globalization of projects has promoted the need for virtual teams that work \n",
      "on the same project, but are not colocated at the same site. The availability of communication technology such as email, audio conferencing, social media, web-based meetings, and video conferencing has made virtual teams feasible. Managing virtual teams has unique advantages, such as being able to use special expertise on a project team even when the expert is not in the same geographic area, incorporating employees who work from home ofﬁces, and including people with mobility limitations or disabilities. The challenges of managing virtual teams are mainly in the communication domain, including a possible feeling of isolation, gaps in sharing knowledge and experience between team members, and difﬁculties in tracking progress and productivity, possible time zone difference and cultural differences.\n",
      "TAILORI NG C ONSI DERA TIONS\n",

      "oriented formats. Some project assignments are listed in subsidiary plans, such as the risk, quality, or communications management plans. Regardless of the method used to document team member roles, the objective is to ensure that each work package has an unambiguous owner and that all team members have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities. A hierarchical format may be used to represent high-level roles, while a text-based format may be better suited to document the detailed responsibilities.\n",
      "uuHierarchical charts. The traditional organizational chart structure can be used to show positions and relationships in a graphical, top-down format.\n",
      "u nWork breakdown structures (WBS). The WBS is designed to show how project deliverables are broken down into work packages and provide a way of showing high-level areas of responsibility.\n",
      "u nOrganizational breakdown structure (OBS). While the WBS shows a breakdown of project deliverables, an OBS is arranged according to an organization’s existing departments, units, or teams, with the project activities or work packages listed under each department. An operational department, such as information technology or purchasing, can see all of its project responsibilities by looking at its portion of the OBS.\n",
      "u nResource breakdown structure. The resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical list of team and physical resources related by category and resource type that is used for planning, managing and controlling project work. Each descending (lower) level represents an increasingly detailed description of the resource until the information is small enough to be used in conjunction with the work breakdown structure (WBS) to allow the work to be planned, monitored, and controlled.\n",
      "317uuAssignment Matrix. A RAM shows the project resources assigned to each work package. It is used to illustrate \n",
      "the connections between work packages, or activities, and project team members. On larger projects, RAMs can be developed at various levels. For example, a high-level RAM can deﬁne the responsibilities of a project team, group, or unit within each component of the WBS. Lower-level RAMs are used within the group to designate roles, responsibilities, and levels of authority for speciﬁc activities. The matrix format shows all activities associated with one person and all people associated with one activity. This also ensures that there is only one person accountable for any one task to avoid confusion about who is ultimately in charge or has authority for the work. One example of a RAM is a RACI (responsible, accountable, consult, and inform) chart, shown in Figure 9-4. The sample chart shows the work to be done in the left column as activities. The assigned resources can be shown as individuals or groups. The project manager can select other options, such as “lead” and “resource” designations, as appropriate for the project. A RACI chart is a useful tool to use to ensure clear assignment of roles and responsibilities when the team consists of internal and external resources.\n",

      "deliverables having the same functional use but different technical characteristics. The project manager and the project management team are responsible for managing the trade-offs associated with delivering the required levels of both quality and grade. While a quality level that fails to meet quality requirements is always a problem, a low-grade product may not be a problem. For example:\n",
      "It may not be a problem if a suitable low-grade product (one with a limited number of features) is of high quality (no obvious defects). In this example, the product would be appropriate for its general purpose of use.\n",
      "It may be a problem if a high-grade product (one with numerous features) is of low quality (many defects). In essence, a high-grade feature set would prove ineffective and/or inefﬁcient due to low quality.\n",
      "Prevention is preferred over inspection. It is better to design quality into deliverables, rather than to ﬁnd quality issues \n",
      "during inspection. The cost of preventing mistakes is generally much less than the cost of correcting mistakes when they are found by inspection or during usage.\n",
      "Depending on the project and the industry area, the project team may need a working knowledge of statistical control \n",
      "processes to evaluate data contained in the Control Quality outputs. The team should know the differences between the following pairs of terms:\n",
      "Prevention (keeping errors out of the process) and inspection (keeping errors out of the hands of the customer);\n",
      "Attribute sampling (the result either conforms or does not conform) and variable sampling (the result is rated on a continuous scale that measures the degree of conformity); and\n",

      "nonconformance to requirements, appraising the product or service for conformance to requirements, and failing to meet requirements (rework). Failure costs are often categorized into internal (found by the project team) and external (found by the customer). Failure costs are also called the cost of poor quality. Section 8.1.2.3 provides some examples to consider in each area. Organizations choose to invest in defect prevention because of the beneﬁts over the life of the product. Because projects are temporary, decisions about the COQ over a product’s life cycle are often the concern of program management, portfolio management, the PMO, or operations.\n",
      "275There are ﬁve levels of increasingly effective quality management as follows:\n",
      "Usually, the most expensive approach is to let the customer ﬁnd the defects. This approach can lead to warranty \n",
      "issues, recalls, loss of reputation, and rework costs.\n",
      "Detect and correct the defects before the deliverables are sent to the customer as part of the quality control process. The control quality process has related costs, which are mainly the appraisal costs and internal failure costs.\n",
      "Use quality assurance to examine and correct the process itself and not just special defects.\n",

      "Customer satisfaction. Understand, evaluate, deﬁne, and manage requirements so that customer expectations are met. This requires a combination of conformance to requirements (to ensure the project produces what it was created to produce) and ﬁtness for use (the product or service needs to satisfy the real needs). In agile environments, stakeholder engagement with the team ensures customer satisfaction is maintained throughout the project.\n",
      "Continual improvement. The plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle is the basis for quality improvement as deﬁned by Shewhart and modiﬁed by Deming. In addition, quality improvement initiatives such as total quality management (TQM), Six Sigma, and Lean Six Sigma may improve both the quality of project management, as well as the quality of the end product, service, or result.\n",
      "Management responsibility. Success requires the participation of all members of the project team. Management retains, within its responsibility for quality, a related responsibility to provide suitable resources at adequate capacities.\n",
      "Mutually beneficial partnership with suppliers. An organization and its suppliers are interdependent. Relationships based on partnership and cooperation with the supplier are more beneﬁcial to the organization and to the suppliers than traditional supplier management. The organization should prefer long-term relationships over short-term gains. A mutually beneﬁcial relationship enhances the ability for both the organization and the suppliers to create value for each other, enhances the joint responses to customer needs and expectations, and optimizes costs and resources.\n",

Flowcharts may prove useful in understanding and estimating the cost of quality for a process. Information is obtained by using the workﬂow branching logic and associated relative frequencies to estimate the expected monetary value for the conformance and nonconformance work required to deliver the expected conforming output. When ﬂowcharts are used to represent the steps in a process, they are sometimes called process ﬂows or process ﬂow diagrams and they can be used for process improvement as well as identifying where quality defects can occur or where to incorporate quality checks.\n",

In addition, modern project resource management approaches seek to optimize resource utilization. Trends and emerging practices for Project Resource Management include but are not limited to:\n",
      "Resource management methods. Due to the scarce nature of critical resources, in some industries, several trends have become popular in the past several years. There is extensive literature about lean management, just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing, Kaizen, total productive maintenance (TPM), theory of constraints (TOC), and other methods. A project manager should determine if the performing organization has adopted one or more resource management tools and adapt the project accordingly.\n",
      "Emotional intelligence (EI). The project manager should invest in personal EI by improving inbound (e.g., \n",
      "self-management and self-awareness) and outbound (e.g., relationship management) competencies. Research suggests that project teams that succeed in developing team EI or become an emotionally competent group are more effective. Additionally, there is a reduction in staff turnover.\n",
      "Self-organizing teams. The increase in using agile approaches mainly for the execution of IT projects has given rise to the self-organizing team, where the team functions with an absence of centralized control. In projects that have self-organizing teams, the project manager (who may not be called a project manager) role provides the team with the environment and support needed and trusts the team to get the job done. Successful self-organizing teams usually consist of generalized specialists, instead of subject matter experts, who continuously adapt to the changing environment and embrace constructive feedback.\n",

The availability of communication technology such as email, audio conferencing, social media, web-based meetings, and video conferencing has made virtual teams feasible. Managing virtual teams has unique advantages, such as being able to use special expertise on a project team even when the expert is not in the same geographic area, incorporating employees who work from home ofﬁces, and including people with mobility limitations or disabilities. The challenges of managing virtual teams are mainly in the communication domain, including a possible feeling of isolation, gaps in sharing knowledge and experience between team members, and difﬁculties in tracking progress and productivity, possible time zone difference and cultural differences.\n",

An operational department, such as information technology or purchasing, can see all of its project responsibilities by looking at its portion of the OBS.\n",
      "u nResource breakdown structure. The resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical list of team and physical resources related by category and resource type that is used for planning, managing and controlling project work. Each descending (lower) level represents an increasingly detailed description of the resource until the information is small enough to be used in conjunction with the work breakdown structure (WBS) to allow the work to be planned, monitored, and controlled.\n",
      "317Assignment Matrix. A RAM shows the project resources assigned to each work package. It is used to illustrate \n",
      "the connections between work packages, or activities, and project team members. On larger projects, RAMs can be developed at various levels. For example, a high-level RAM can deﬁne the responsibilities of a project team, group, or unit within each component of the WBS. Lower-level RAMs are used within the group to designate roles, responsibilities, and levels of authority for speciﬁc activities. The matrix format shows all activities associated with one person and all people associated with one activity. This also ensures that there is only one person accountable for any one task to avoid confusion about who is ultimately in charge or has authority for the work. One example of a RAM is a RACI (responsible, accountable, consult, and inform) chart, shown in Figure 9-4. The sample chart shows the work to be done in the left column as activities. The assigned resources can be shown as individuals or groups. The project manager can select other options, such as “lead” and “resource” designations, as appropriate for the project. A RACI chart is a useful tool to use to ensure clear assignment of roles and responsibilities when the team consists of internal and external resources.\n",
      "Text-oriented formats. Team member responsibilities that require detailed descriptions can be speciﬁed in text-oriented formats. Usually in outline form, these documents provide information such as responsibilities, authority, competencies, and qualiﬁcations.

      "deliverables having the same functional use but different technical characteristics. The project manager and the project management team are responsible for managing the trade-offs associated with delivering the required levels of both quality and grade. While a quality level that fails to meet quality requirements is always a problem, a low-grade product may not be a problem. For example:\n",
      "It may not be a problem if a suitable low-grade product (one with a limited number of features) is of high quality (no obvious defects). In this example, the product would be appropriate for its general purpose of use.\n",
      "It may be a problem if a high-grade product (one with numerous features) is of low quality (many defects). In essence, a high-grade feature set would prove ineffective and/or inefﬁcient due to low quality.\n",
      "Prevention is preferred over inspection. It is better to design quality into deliverables, rather than to ﬁnd quality issues \n",
      "during inspection. The cost of preventing mistakes is generally much less than the cost of correcting mistakes when they are found by inspection or during usage.\n",
      "Depending on the project and the industry area, the project team may need a working knowledge of statistical control \n",
      "processes to evaluate data contained in the Control Quality outputs. The team should know the differences between the following pairs of terms:\n",
      "Prevention (keeping errors out of the process) and inspection (keeping errors out of the hands of the customer);\n",

Failure costs are often categorized into internal (found by the project team) and external (found by the customer). Failure costs are also called the cost of poor quality. Section 8.1.2.3 provides some examples to consider in each area. Organizations choose to invest in defect prevention because of the beneﬁts over the life of the product. Because projects are temporary, decisions about the COQ over a product’s life cycle are often the concern of program management, portfolio management, the PMO, or operations.\n",

In agile environments, stakeholder engagement with the team ensures customer satisfaction is maintained throughout the project.\n",
      "Continual improvement. The plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle is the basis for quality improvement as deﬁned by Shewhart and modiﬁed by Deming. In addition, quality improvement initiatives such as total quality management (TQM), Six Sigma, and Lean Six Sigma may improve both the quality of project management, as well as the quality of the end product, service, or result.\n",
      "Management responsibility. Success requires the participation of all members of the project team. Management retains, within its responsibility for quality, a related responsibility to provide suitable resources at adequate capacities.\n",
      "Mutually beneficial partnership with suppliers. An organization and its suppliers are interdependent. Relationships based on partnership and cooperation with the supplier are more beneﬁcial to the organization and to the suppliers than traditional supplier management. The organization should prefer long-term relationships over short-term gains.

Flowcharts may prove useful in understanding and estimating the cost of quality for a process. Information is obtained by using the workﬂow branching logic and associated relative frequencies to estimate the expected monetary value for the conformance and nonconformance work required to deliver the expected conforming output.

The project manager and appropriate stakeholders may use the statistically calculated control limits to identify the points at which corrective action will be taken to prevent performance that remains outside the control limits. Control charts can be used to monitor various types of output variables. Although used most frequently to track repetitive activities required for producing manufactured lots, control charts may also be used to monitor cost and schedule variances, volume, frequency of scope changes, or other management results to help determine if the project management processes are in control.\n",

      "309There is a distinction between the skills and competencies needed for the project manager to manage team \n",
      "resources versus physical resources. Physical resources include equipment, materials, facilities, and infrastructure. \n",
      "Team resources or personnel refer to the human resources. Personnel may have varied skill sets, may be assigned full- or part-time, and may be added or removed from the project team as the project progresses. There is some overlap between Project Resource Management and Project Stakeholder Management (Section 13). This section (Section 9) focuses on the subset of stakeholders who make up the project team.\n",
      "KEY C ONCEPTS FOR P ROJECT R ESOU RCE M ANAGEMENT\n",
      "The project team consists of individuals with assigned roles and responsibilities who work collectively to achieve \n",
      "a shared project goal. The project manager should invest suitable effort in acquiring, managing, motivating, and \n",
      "empowering the project team. Although speciﬁc roles and responsibilities for the project team members are assigned, the involvement of all team members in project planning and decision making is beneﬁcial. Participation of team members during planning adds their expertise to the process and strengthens their commitment to the project.\n",
      "The project manager should be both leader and manager of the project team. In addition to project management \n",
      "activities such as initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing the various project phases, the project manager is responsible for the team formation as an effective group. The project manager should be aware of different aspects that inﬂuence the team, such as:\n",
      "Team environment,\n",
      "Geographical locations of team members,\n",
      "Communications among stakeholders,\n",
      "Organizational change management,\n",
      "Internal and external politics,\n",
      "Cultural issues and organizational uniqueness, and\n",
      "Other factors that may alter project performance.\n",
      "As a leader, the project manager is also responsible for proactively developing team skills and competencies while \n",
      "retaining and improving team satisfaction and motivation. The project manager should be aware of, and subscribe to, professional and ethical behavior, and ensure that all team members adhere to these behaviors.\n",
      "Physical resource management is concentrated in allocating and using the physical resources (material, equipment, \n",
      "and supplies, for example) needed for successful completion of the project in an efﬁcient and effective way. In order to do \n",
      "that, organizations should have data on resource demands (now and in the reasonable future), resource conﬁgurations that will be required to meet those demands, and the supply of resources. Failing to manage and control resources efﬁciently is a source of risk for successful project completion. For example:\n",
      "Failing to secure critical equipment or infrastructure on time may result in delays in the manufacturing of the ﬁnal product,\n",
      "Ordering low-quality material may damage the quality of the product causing a high rate of recalls or rework, and\n",
      "Keeping too much inventory may result in high operations costs and reduce the organization’s proﬁt. Unacceptably low inventory level, on the other hand, may result in not satisfying customer demand and, again, reduce the organization’s proﬁt.\n",
      "TRENDS AND E MERGI NG P RACTI CES I N PROJECT R ESOU RCE M ANAGEMENT\n",
      "Project management styles are shifting away from a command and control structure for managing projects and \n",
      "toward a more collaborative and supportive management approach that empowers teams by delegating decision making to the team members. In addition, modern project resource management approaches seek to optimize resource utilization. Trends and emerging practices for Project Resource Management include but are not limited to:\n",
      "Resource management methods. Due to the scarce nature of critical resources, in some industries, several trends have become popular in the past several years. There is extensive literature about lean management, just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing, Kaizen, total productive maintenance (TPM), theory of constraints (TOC), and other methods. A project manager should determine if the performing organization has adopted one or more resource management tools and adapt the project accordingly.\n",
      "Emotional intelligence (EI). The project manager should invest in personal EI by improving inbound (e.g., \n",
      "self-management and self-awareness) and outbound (e.g., relationship management) competencies. Research suggests that project teams that succeed in developing team EI or become an emotionally competent group are more effective. Additionally, there is a reduction in staff turnover.\n",
      "Self-organizing teams. The increase in using agile approaches mainly for the execution of IT projects has given rise to the self-organizing team, where the team functions with an absence of centralized control. In projects that have self-organizing teams, the project manager (who may not be called a project manager) role provides the team with the environment and support needed and trusts the team to get the job done. Successful self-organizing teams usually consist of generalized specialists, instead of subject matter experts, who continuously adapt to the changing environment and embrace constructive feedback.\n",
      "311Virtual teams/distributed teams. The globalization of projects has promoted the need for virtual teams that work \n",
      "on the same project, but are not colocated at the same site. The availability of communication technology such as email, audio conferencing, social media, web-based meetings, and video conferencing has made virtual teams feasible. Managing virtual teams has unique advantages, such as being able to use special expertise on a project team even when the expert is not in the same geographic area, incorporating employees who work from home ofﬁces, and including people with mobility limitations or disabilities. The challenges of managing virtual teams are mainly in the communication domain, including a possible feeling of isolation, gaps in sharing knowledge and experience between team members, and difﬁculties in tracking progress and productivity, possible time zone difference and cultural differences.\n",
      "TAILORI NG C ONSI DERA TIONS\n",
      "Because each project is unique, the project manager will need to tailor the way Project Resource Management \n",
      "processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:\n",
      "Diversity. What is the diversity background of the team?\n",
      "Physical location. What is the physical location of team members and physical resources?\n",
      "Industry-specific resources. What special resources are needed in the industry?\n",

      "oriented formats. Some project assignments are listed in subsidiary plans, such as the risk, quality, or communications management plans. Regardless of the method used to document team member roles, the objective is to ensure that each work package has an unambiguous owner and that all team members have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities. A hierarchical format may be used to represent high-level roles, while a text-based format may be better suited to document the detailed responsibilities.\n",
      "Hierarchical charts. The traditional organizational chart structure can be used to show positions and relationships in a graphical, top-down format.\n",
      "Work breakdown structures (WBS). The WBS is designed to show how project deliverables are broken down into work packages and provide a way of showing high-level areas of responsibility.\n",
      "Organizational breakdown structure (OBS). While the WBS shows a breakdown of project deliverables, an OBS is arranged according to an organization’s existing departments, units, or teams, with the project activities or work packages listed under each department. An operational department, such as information technology or purchasing, can see all of its project responsibilities by looking at its portion of the OBS.\n",
      "Resource breakdown structure. The resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical list of team and physical resources related by category and resource type that is used for planning, managing and controlling project work. Each descending (lower) level represents an increasingly detailed description of the resource until the information is small enough to be used in conjunction with the work breakdown structure (WBS) to allow the work to be planned, monitored, and controlled.\n",
      "317Assignment Matrix. A RAM shows the project resources assigned to each work package. It is used to illustrate \n",
      "the connections between work packages, or activities, and project team members. On larger projects, RAMs can be developed at various levels. For example, a high-level RAM can deﬁne the responsibilities of a project team, group, or unit within each component of the WBS. Lower-level RAMs are used within the group to designate roles, responsibilities, and levels of authority for speciﬁc activities. The matrix format shows all activities associated with one person and all people associated with one activity. This also ensures that there is only one person accountable for any one task to avoid confusion about who is ultimately in charge or has authority for the work. One example of a RAM is a RACI (responsible, accountable, consult, and inform) chart, shown in Figure 9-4. The sample chart shows the work to be done in the left column as activities. The assigned resources can be shown as individuals or groups. The project manager can select other options, such as “lead” and “resource” designations, as appropriate for the project. A RACI chart is a useful tool to use to ensure clear assignment of roles and responsibilities when the team consists of internal and external resources.\n",
      "Text-oriented formats. Team member responsibilities that require detailed descriptions can be speciﬁed in text-oriented formats. Usually in outline form, these documents provide information such as responsibilities, authority, competencies, and qualiﬁcations. The documents are known by various names including position descriptions and role-responsibility-authority forms. These documents can be used as templates for future projects, especially when the information is updated throughout the current project by applying lessons learned.\n",
